that will be in about fifteen minutes from now i figure murmured frank sheldon to his friend and comrade bart raymond as he glanced at the hands of his radio watch and then put it up to his ear to make sure that it had not stopped   it'll seem more like fifteen hours muttered tom bradford who was on the other side of sheldon   tom's in a hurry to get at the huns chuckled billy waldon   he wants to show them where they get off   
i saw him putting a razor edge on his bayonet last night added bart   now he's anxious to see how it works   he'll have plenty of chances to find out said frank   this is going to be a hot scrap or i miss my guess   
i heard the captain tell the lieutenant that the germans had their heaviest force right in front of our part of the line   so much the better asserted billy stoutly   they can't come too thick or too fast   they've been sneering at what the yankees were going to do in this war and it's about time they got punctures in their tires   
at this moment the mess helpers passed along the line with buckets of steaming hot coffee and the men welcomed it eagerly for it was late in the autumn and the night air was chill and penetrating   come little cup to one who loves thee well murmured tom as he swallowed his portion in one gulp   the others were not slow in following his example and the buckets were emptied in a twinkling   then the stern vigil was renewed   
from the opposing lines a star shell rose and exploded casting a greenish radiance over the barren stretch of no man's land that separated the hostile forces   fritz isn't asleep muttered frank   he's right on the job with his fireworks agreed bart   maybe he has his suspicions that we're going to give him a little surprise party remarked billy and that's his way of telling us that he's ready to welcome us with open arms   
fix bayonets    came the command from the officer in charge and there was a faint clink as the order was obeyed   it won't be long now murmured tom but why don't the guns open up    they always do before it's time to charge commented billy as he shifted his position a little   
i suppose they will now almost any minute   i don't think there'll be any gun fire this time before we go over the top ventured frank   what do you mean    asked bart in surprise as he turned his head toward his chum   
do you know anything    queried tom not exactly know but i've heard enough to make a guess replied frank   i think we're going to play the game a little differently this time   unless i'm mistaken the huns are going to get the surprise of their lives   
put on gas masks    came another order and in the six seconds allowed for this operation the masks were donned making the men in the long line look like so many goblins   it was light enough for them to see each other now for the gray fingers of the dawn were already drawing the curtain of darkness aside from the eastern sky   one minute more passed a minute of tense fierce expectation while the boys gripped their rifles until it seemed that their fingers would bury themselves in the stocks   
crash    with a roar louder than a thousand guns the earth under the german first line trenches split asunder and tons of rock and mud and guns and men were hurled toward the sky   the din was terrific the sight appalling and the shock for an instant was almost as great to the americans as to their opponents though far less tragic   now men shouted their lieutenant over with you   
 and with a wild yell of exultation the boys clambered over the edge of the trench and started toward the german lines   we're off    panted frank as with eyes blazing and bayonet ready for instant use he rushed forward in the front rank   to a flying start   
 gasped bart and then because breath was precious they said no more but raced on like greyhounds freed from the leash   on on they went with the wind whipping their faces    on still on to the red ruin wrought by the explosion of the mine   for the first fifty yards the going was easy except for the craters and shell holes into which some of the boys slid and tumbled   
the enemy had been so numbed and paralyzed by the overwhelming explosion that they seemed to be unable to make any resistance   but the officers knew and the men as well that this was only the lull before the storm   their enemy was desperate and resourceful and though the cleverness of the american engineers had carried through the mine operation without detection it was certain that the foe would rally   fifty yards from the first line trench forty thirty and then the german guns spoke   
a long line of flame flared up crimson in the pallid dawn   down men down    shouted their officers and the yankee lads threw themselves flat on the ground while a leaden hail swept furiously over them   are you hurt bart   
 cried frank anxiously as he heard a sharp exclamation from his comrade   not by a bullet growled bart   took some of the skin off my knee though when i went down   a second time the murderous fire came hurtling over them but the officers noted with satisfaction that the enemy were shooting high   
they haven't got the range yet observed billy   up    came the word of command and again the men were on their feet and racing like mad toward the trench   they came at last to where it had been   
for it was no longer a trench    gone was the zigzag line that the boys knew by heart from having faced and fought against it for weeks   the mine had done its work thoroughly   everywhere was a welter of hideous confusion   
barbed wire entanglements with their supporting posts had been rooted from the ground   guns had been torn from their carriages   pill boxes had been smashed to bits   horses and men and wagons and camp kitchens were mingled together in wildest chaos   
parts of the trench had been filled to the surface with earth while huge boulders blocked the entrance to some of the communicating passages   there were a few sharp fights with scattered units of the enemy that had retained their senses and were trying to get their machine guns into action   but these detachments were soon cut down or captured   the great majority of the survivors were so dazed that they surrendered with scarcely a show of resistance and were rounded up in squads to be sent to the rear   
the first trench had been won and it was almost a bloodless victory only a few of the american troops having fallen in the sudden rush   but sterner work lay ahead for the second and third german lines were still intact bristling with men and supported heavily by their guns   this was easy grinned billy   like taking a dead mouse from a blind kitten chuckled tom as he wiped the grime and perspiration from his face   
don't fool yourselves warned frank as a shell came whining over their heads   this was only a skirmish   the real fight is coming and coming mighty quick    chapter i.i. the uplifted knife even while frank sheldon spoke the artillery of the enemy took on a deeper note until it reached the intensity of drumfire   
but now the american gunners took a hand and the shells came pouring over the heads of the boys searching out the line of the second enemy trench and preparing the way for the advance   in obedience to commands the american soldiers had sought shelter wherever they could find it while they were recovering their wind   only a moment could be granted for this however for time was everything just now   they had caught the enemy off his guard and must take advantage of the opportunity   
line up men    cried the leader of frank's detachment and the high state of discipline that the american forces had reached was shown by the promptness with which the order was obeyed   a signal was sent back to the supporting guns and they opened up a deadly barrage fire over the heads of frank and his comrades clearing the ground before them of everything that dared to show itself in the open   behind this curtain of fire the boys advanced slowly at first but gathering speed at every stride until they were running at the double quick   
bullets rained about them from the machine guns of the enemy and great shells tore gaps in the ranks   at frank's left a soldier suddenly wavered and then pitched headlong into a shell hole and lay still   another toppled over with a bullet in his shoulder   but the lanes that were made closed almost instantly   
now they had reached the wire entanglements that had been battered by the artillery until they hung in festoons around their posts leaving paths through which the american lads poured   then like a great tidal wave they struck the trench    the germans had clambered out to meet them and when the two forces met the shock was terrific   back and forth the battle surged and swayed each side fighting with the fury of desperation   
the cannon had ceased now for in that locked mass the shells were as likely to kill friends as foes   it was man against man bayonet against bayonet each combatant obeying the primitive law of kill or be killed   the opposing forces at this part of the line were nearly equal with the germans having a slight advantage in numbers   but to make up for this the americans had the advantage of the attack and the tremendous momentum with which they had struck the enemy's line   
for a time victory hung in the balance but then yankee determination and superior skill in bayonet work began to tell   the americans would not be denied   the german line was pierced and the forces broke up into a number of battling groups   frank and bart billy and tom who all through the fight had managed to keep together found themselves engaged with a squad of germans double their number two of whom were frantically trying to bring a machine gun to bear upon them   
with a bound frank was upon them   he toppled one over with his bayonet but while he was doing this the other fired at him point blank with a revolver   at such a close range he could not have missed had not bart quick as a flash clubbed him over the arm with his rifle making the bullet go wild   quick bart   
 panted frank as with his comrade's help he slued the machine gun around gripped the trigger and sent a stream of bullets into a group of the enemy charging down upon him   before that withering fire they dissolved like mist and a circle was cleared as though by magic   what germans were left in that immediate vicinity leaped back into the trench on the edge of which they had been fighting   now we've got them   
 cried frank as with his friends' assistance he quickly wheeled the gun to the brink of the trench and depressed the muzzle so that it commanded the huddled bunch below   come out of that you fellows   hands up quick    they may not have understood his words but there was no misunderstanding the meaning of that black sinister muzzle of the machine gun with a hundred deaths behind it   
they were trapped and their hands went up with cries of kamerad    in token of surrender   on that part of the line the battle was over for the plan did not contemplate going beyond the second trench at that time   the american boys had won and won gloriously   
from all parts of the trench on a two mile front groups of captives were coming sullenly out with uplifted hands to be herded into groups by their captors and sent to the rear   glory hallelujah    cried bart as he removed his mask and wiped his streaming face   and no gas either   
some scrap    gasped billy as he sank exhausted to the ground   did them up to the queen's taste chuckled tom we certainly put one over on the huns that time grinned frank happily   and while they stand there breathless and exulting it may be well for the benefit of those who have not previously made the acquaintance of the american army boys to sketch briefly their adventures up to the time this story opens   
frank sheldon bart raymond tom bradford and billy waldon had all been born and brought up in camport a thriving american city of about twenty five thousand people   they had known each other from boyhood attended the same school played on the same baseball nine and were warm friends   frank was the natural leader of the group   he was a tall muscular young fellow quick to think and quick to act always at the front in sports as well as in the more serious events of life   
his father had died some years before leaving only a modest home as a legacy and frank was the sole support of his mother   the latter had been born in france where mr. sheldon had married her and brought her to america   later mrs. sheldon's father had died leaving her a considerable property in auvergne her native province   this estate however had been tied up in a lawsuit and she had not come into possession of it   
she had been planning to go to france to look after her interests but her husband's death and later on the breaking out of the european war had made this impossible   she was a charming woman with all the french sparkle and vivacity and she and her son were bound together in ties of the strongest affection   naturally her ardent sympathy had been with france in the great war raging in europe   but when it became evident that america soon would take part although she welcomed the aid this would bring to her native country her mother heart was torn with anguish at the thought that her only son would probably join in the fighting across the sea   
but frank though he dreaded the separation felt that he must join the camport regiment that was getting ready to fight the huns   the deciding moment came when a german tore down the american flag from a neighbor's porch   frank knocked the fellow down and in the presence of an excited throng made him kiss the flag that he had insulted   from that moment his resolution was taken and his mother who had witnessed the scene gave her consent to his joining the old thirty seventh regiment made up chiefly of camport boys including billy waldon who had seen service on the mexican border   
bart raymond frank's special chum a sturdy vigorous young fellow was equally patriotic and joined the regiment with frank as soon as war was declared   tom bradford a fellow employee in the firm of moore and thomas a thriving hardware house wanted to enlist but was rejected on account of his teeth although he wrathfully declared that he wanted to shoot the germans not to bite them   in fact almost all the young fellows employed by the firm except reddy the office boy who wanted to go badly enough but who was too young tried to get into some branch of the army or navy   a marked exception was nick rabig the foreman of the shipping department who although born in the united states came of german parents and lost no opportunity of boosting germany and knocking america   
he was the bully of the place and universally disliked   he hated frank especially after the flag incident and only the thought of his mother had prevented frank more than once from giving rabig the thrashing he deserved   frank's regiment was sent to camp boone for their preliminary training and here the young recruits were put through their paces in rifle shooting grenade throwing bayonet practice and all the other exercises by which uncle sam turns his boys into soldiers   there was plenty of fun mixed in with the hard work and they had many stirring experiences   
a pleasant feature was the coming of tom who although rejected when he tried to enlist had been accepted in the draft   not so pleasant though somewhat amusing was the fact that nick rabig also had been drafted and had to go to camp boone though most unwillingly   how the regiment sailed to france for intensive training behind the firing lines how their transport narrowly escaped being sunk by a submarine and how the tables were turned the singular chance by which frank met a french colonel and heard encouraging news about his mother's property how he thoroughly trimmed rabig in a boxing bout how the camport boys took part in the capture of a zeppelin how the old thirty seventh finally reached the trenches frank's daring exploit when caught in the swirl of a german charge these and other exciting adventures are told in the first book of this series entitled army boys in france or from training camp to the trenches   do you remember what that airship captain said the day we bagged him   
 chuckled billy   about it being impossible for americans to get to france    asked bart   you bet i do   
i'll never forget that boob   i wonder if he still believes it   he'd sing a different tune if he were here to day observed tom i don't know laughed frank   the german skull is pretty thick   
still you can get something through it once in a while if you keep on hammering   i guess these fellows haven't any doubts about our being here observed billy   they've had pretty good evidence of it confirmed tom as he watched the enemy captives standing about in dejected groups waiting to be sent to the rear   one thing that struck the boys forcibly was the disparity of age between the prisoners   
there was an unusual proportion of men beyond middle life and of youngsters still in their teens   grandpas and kids blurted out tom the kaiser's robbing the cradle and the grave commented billy   germany's getting pretty near to the limit of her man power i guess   that's true of france and england too observed frank thoughtfully   
they lost the flower of their troops in the early fighting and they all have to do a great deal of combing to keep their ranks full   and that's where america has the indian sign on the huns jubilated bart we'll have our best against her second best   we'll trim her good and proper predicted frank   even at her best we'd down her in the end   
but don't let's kid ourselves   she's full of fight yet and will take a lot of beating   and there are plenty of huskies in her ranks yet   look at that big brute over there   
he looks as though he could lift an ox   he pointed to a massively built german corporal who was evidently mad with rage at his capture   he was gesticulating wildly to his fellow prisoners and fairly sputtering in the attempt to relieve his feelings   seems to be rather peeved grinned tom i can't catch on to what he's saying laughed bart   
but i'll bet he could give points to a new york truckman or the mate of a mississippi steamboat   they'd turn green with envy if they could understand him   he's frothing at the mouth chuckled billy   i'd hate to have him bite me just now   
i'd get hydrophobia sure   there was no time for further comment   the officers had had to give the men a short breathing spell for all were spent with their tremendous exertions   but now after the brief rest all was bustle and hurry   
the huns will be back for more predicted frank as he and his friends were set to work changing the sandbags from the side of the trench that had faced the americans to the other side that looked toward the german third line   they must be hard to please if they haven't had enough for one morning growled tom they're gluttons for punishment remarked bart   the first line trench is junk from the mine explosion but they won't give this second one up without making one mighty effort to get it back   the young soldiers were working feverishly to organize the captured position when their corporal wilson summoned them out and they scrambled forth promptly and stood at attention   
fall in to take back the prisoners he ordered   a look of disappointment came over their faces and wilson's eyes twinkled when he saw it   haven't you had enough fighting yet    he demanded   
well i feel that way myself but orders are orders   come along   hard luck muttered frank in a low tone to bart as they obeyed the command   we'll miss some lovely fighting agreed bart   
i was just getting warmed up mourned billy   don't worry advised tom we'll be sent back after we get these fellows to headquarters and we'll have a chance to get another crack at them   the prisoners having been searched were placed in double file between the members of the guarding squad who walked at a few paces interval on either side of them   fall in   
 came the corporal's order   shoulder arms   march    they started out briskly   
frank and bart happened to be close beside the big german corporal whom they had before observed   his wrath was not yet abated and he kept up a volley of epithets as he sullenly marched along   he's making as much fuss as though he were the kaiser chuckled tom who was vastly amused at the prisoner's antics   slap him on the wrist and tell him to be nice counseled billy with a grin   
the captive glared at them with insane rage in his eyes   i think he's going nutty remarked bart   it's lucky for him there aren't any squirrels around   you want to keep your eye peeled for him warned frank   
he's bad medicine   he's safe enough replied bart carelessly   he hasn't any weapon and if he started to run he wouldn't get far   he isn't cut out for a sprinter   
even if he were a bullet would catch him chimed in billy   he'd make a big target and it would be a pretty bad shot that would miss him   when they reached the blown up first trench they found it difficult to keep in line and had to pick their way over the heaped up ruin that had been made by the mine explosion   bart tripped over a strand of broken wire and in trying to save himself from falling his rifle slipped from his hand   
the german corporal was within a foot of him and saw his opportunity   quick as a flash he drew from his clothing a trench knife that the searchers had overlooked   the murderous blade gleamed in the air as the corporal brought it down toward the neck of bart who had stooped to pick up his rifle   chapter i.i.i. taking chances look out bart   
 yelled billy while tom made a desperate leap to his comrade's rescue   but frank was quicker than either   like lightning he lunged with his bayonet and caught the german in the wrist just as the knife was about to bury itself in bart's neck   with a howl of rage and pain as his arm was forced upward the prisoner's hand lost its grip on the weapon and it clattered harmlessly to the ground   
in an instant the german was overpowered and his arms tied behind him with his own belt   then his wounded wrist was bound up with a surgical dressing and under a special guard he was urged forward in no gentle manner for all were at a white heat at his treacherous attempt   by the laws of war his life was forfeited and he seemed to realize this for all his bravado vanished and from time to time he looked fearfully at his captors   he saw little there to encourage him for bart was a great favorite with his company and the attack had stirred them to the depths   
a close call old man   said frank affectionately tapping his friend on the shoulder   it would have been taps for me all right if you hadn't acted as quickly as you did responded bart gratefully   frank was johnny on the spot said billy admiringly   
my heart was in my mouth when i saw that knife coming down   it was a waste of time to tie up that fellow's arm remarked tom as he glowered at the miscreant   he'll soon be where he won't need any bandages   i guess it's a case for a firing squad judged billy   
but it serves him right for it was up to him to play the game   before long they reached headquarters and delivered up their prisoners   if they had expected to be sent back immediately to the firing line they were disappointed for the examination of the prisoners began at once without the squad receiving notice of dismissal   this had its compensations however for although they had captured prisoners before they had never been present at their examination and they were curious to see the turn the questioning would take   
captain baker of the old thirty seventh was detailed to do the examining and because time was precious and it was most important to learn just what enemy units were opposed to the american forces he got to work at once an interpreter standing at his side while a stenographer made note of the replies   the captain signaled to one of the most intelligent looking of the prisoners and the latter stepped out clicked his heels together smartly and saluted   what is your name    asked the captain   
rudolph schmidt   your regiment    the seventy ninth bavarian   who is your colonel   
 von armin   who commands your division    general hofer   who is your corps commander   
 prince lichtenstein   how many men have you lost in the last few days' fighting    obstinate silence   the captain repeated the question   
i do not know the prisoner answered evasively   well were your losses heavy or light    pursued the captain patiently   i cannot tell   
the captain switched to another line   do you know who have captured you    he asked   the english was the prompt answer   
no replied the captain   we are americans   the prisoner permitted himself an incredulous smile   can't you see these are american uniforms   
 asked the captain with a sweep of his arm   yes was the reply   but our captain tells us that the english wear that uniform to make us think that the americans have arrived in france   a grin went around the circle of listeners   
you blawsted bloody britisher chuckled bart giving frank a poke in the ribs   where's my bally monocle old top    whispered frank while billy and tom grew red in the face from trying to control their merriment   the captain himself had all he could do to maintain his gravity   
do you believe your captain when he tells you that    he inquired   i must believe him answered the prisoner simply   there's discipline for you muttered billy   
such childlike faith murmured tom but even if the americans are not already here persisted the captain don't you believe they are coming    they may try to come answered the captive doubtfully but if they do they will never get here   why not   our u. boats will stop them   
that settles it whispered bart   we think we're here but we're only kidding ourselves   we can't be here   heinie says so and of course he knows   
what a come on he'd be for the confidence men gurgled billy   they'd sell him the brooklyn bridge before he'd been on shore for an hour   questioned as to food supplies the german admitted that their rations although fairly good were not so abundant as at the beginning of the war   then with characteristic arrogance he added but we will have plenty to eat and drink too when we get to paris   
i suppose your captain tells you that too remarked the inquisitor   yes was the reply   that eternal captain again murmured bart   he must be a wonder chuckled tom you've been rather a long time on the road to paris haven't you   
 asked the captain with a tinge of sarcasm   seems to me i've heard something about a banquet that was to celebrate the crown prince's entry into paris a month after the war was started   a discomfited look stole over the prisoner's face   that was von kluck's fault he said sullenly   
seems to me the french army had something to do with it too whispered frank to bart   what does your captain tell you your armies are fighting for    continued the questioner   to give germany her place in the sun answered the prisoner without hesitation   
that seems to be a stock phrase of the huns whispered billy   i'll bet it's part of the lesson taught in every german school   a few more questions followed but failed to elicit any information of special importance and the prisoner was dismissed to have his place taken by some of his comrades   but what they told the boys never knew for just then corporal wilson who had been in close conference with his lieutenant beckoned to them and they filed silently out of the quarters   
back to the firing line for us remarked frank   about time too replied bart as he shouldered his rifle   we've been missing all the fun   but the first words of the corporal showed them that they were mistaken   
you lads are out of it for the rest of the day he remarked   go back to your old trench now get some grub and tumble into your bunks   they looked at each other in surprise for the sun had not much more than risen   you heard what i said reiterated the corporal   
get all the sleep you can to day for you won't do any sleeping to night chapter i.v. between the lines the army boys looked at each other in blank inquiry but the corporal did not offer to enlighten them and they were too good soldiers to ask questions when orders were given   what do you suppose is in the wind now    asked bart as they made their way to their sleeping quarters   search me replied frank   
aeroplanes chirped billy   bart made a thrust at him which billy dodged   i guess we're picked for a scouting party remarked tom the captain may want to confirm some of the information he's getting from those chaps   information   
 snorted bart   more likely misinformation   those fellows struck me as being dandy liars   they wouldn't be huns if they weren't remarked billy   
you know baron munchausen came from over the rhine so they come rightly by their talent in that line   but what's the matter with tony here    he added as they passed by one of the field kitchens in a protected nook where one of the bakers was kneading away desperately at some dough and muttering volubly to himself   he seems all riled up about something for a fact commented frank   
what's the matter tony    inquired bart of the perspiring baker an italian who had spent some years in the united states and who was generally liked by the boys of the old thirty seventh because of his customary good nature and his skill in compounding their favorite dishes   tony looked up in despair   i can't maka de dough he complained   
i worka more dan hour   it lika de sand   it getta my goat   the boys laughed at his woe begone face   
put some more water with it suggested billy at a venture   tony looked at him with such a glare of contempt that the amateur baker wilted   i usa de water    he exclaimed   
plent water    no maka de stick   it looks all right remarked frank as he picked up some of the substance on the kneading board and let it dribble through his fingers but as tony says it's like so much sand   and it tastes queer said billy putting a bit of it on his tongue   
looks as though some of the food profiteers were trying to put something over on us observed tom just then one of the commissary men came along evidently looking for something   there's a bag of trench foot powder missing he said   have any of you chaps seen anything of it    not guilty returned bart   
though the way my feet feel it wouldn't do them a bit of harm to have some of that powder on them right now   a sudden light dawned upon frank   say tony    he exclaimed let's see the bag you got that flour from   
tony complied and brought forth from one of his receptacles a large paper bag which was two thirds full   frank seized it and turned it around to see what was stamped on the other side   then he almost dropped the bag in a wild fit of hilarity   no wonder tony couldn't make his dough   
 he exclaimed when he could speak   some chump in the supply department has handed him out a bag of foot powder when he asked for flour   he showed the others the marking on the bag and their merriment equaled his own while tony alternately glowered and grinned   he had begun to think that somebody had cast on him the evil eye so dreaded by his countrymen and he was relieved to find that his plight was due to natural causes   
yet the thought of all that wasted effort stirred him to resentment   that's one on you tony old boy    chuckled billy with a poke in the ribs   it's lucky the dough wouldn't stick laughed frank   
there wouldn't have been much nourishment in that kind of bread   dat guy a bonehead asserted tony as he scraped his board with vigor   a vera beeg bonehead   the boys assented and passed on laughing   
and now for grub    exclaimed billy   oh boy maybe it won't taste good    i guess we've earned our breakfast all right said bart   
i can stand a whole lot of filling up observed tom talk about exercise before breakfast to get you an appetite   we've sure had enough of it this morning   i never ran so fast in my life declared billy   a marathon runner would have had nothing on me   
we must have covered the space between those trenches in about twenty seconds agreed bart   well as long as we weren't running in the wrong direction it was all right grinned tom the boches haven't seen our backs yet and here's hoping it will be some time before they'll have that treat said frank with a laugh   they ate like famished wolves and then threw themselves on their bunks to get a long sleep in preparation for the strenuous night that lay before them   and so used had they already become to roaring of cannon and whining of bullets and shrieking of shells that although the din was almost incessant all through that day it bothered them not at all   
it was nearly dusk when the corporal passed along giving them a shake that roused them from their slumbers and brought them out of their bunks in a hurry   time to get up boys said the corporal   not that we're going to start out right away   but we've got quite a job before us and i want you to have plenty of time to think over your instructions and have them sink in   
they dressed quickly and after a hearty supper reported to wilson at their company headquarters   they found the corporal grave and preoccupied   as i suppose you fellows have already guessed he began we're going to night on a scouting party   we're to find out the condition of the wire in front of that third trench that the huns still hold and we want to get more exact information about the location of the enemy's machine guns   
anything else we find out will be welcome but those are the main things   it's going to be pretty risky work he continued   not but what there's always plenty of risk about a job of this kind but to night there's more than usual   the fierce fighting to day has got the enemy all stirred up and he'll be on the alert   
likely enough he'll have scouting parties of his own out and we may run across them in the dark   then it will be a question of who is the quicker with knife or bayonet   now you boys scatter and get your crawling suits and hoods and masks and we'll be ready for business   i can see that there'll be no monotony in our young lives to night observed frank to bart as they obeyed instructions   
not that you can notice agreed bart   the corp has quite a little program marked out for us   so it seems   and no man's land is going to be a little rougher land to night than it ever was before predicted tom that mine explosion hasn't done a thing to it   
all the better chimed in billy   there'll be better places to hide in when fritz throws up his star shells   but let's get a hustle on or the corp will be after us   they got into their crawling suits so named because they were used only on scouting duty when it was necessary to move over the earth on their stomachs or at best on hands and knees   
they were a dead black in color and in addition to the suit itself comprised a black mask and hood   the hood was loose and shapeless so as to avoid the sharp outline that would have been afforded if it were tight fitting dressed in this fashion and lying prone and motionless on the ground whenever a star shell threw its greenish radiance over the field the scouts were reasonably safe from detection and sniping   they would seem if seen at all to be just so many more objects added to the hundreds that littered up the ground between the two armies   since they had been in france the boys had had special training in scouting duty and the one thing that had been drilled into them perhaps more than anything else was the necessity for playing dead as tom expressed it   
one of their exercises compelled them to lie on the ground absolutely motionless for an hour   not even a muscle could twitch without bringing a reprimand from their keen eyed instructor   another part of the drill made them take half an hour merely to rise to their feet from a prostrate position each move in the process being marked by the utmost caution   it was hard drill but necessary and in time the boys had gained a control over their muscles that would have done credit to an apache indian   
in a few minutes they were fully arrayed in their crawling suits and reported to corporal wilson   he looked them over carefully and noted with satisfaction that nothing that was essential to the success of their night foray was lacking   with a fair share of luck we'll bring home the bacon he remarked as he led the way from the trench   at the start there was no special caution necessary as would have been the case the day before   
for the two trenches in front of them that had been occupied by the enemy were now in the possession of the united states troops   all that day since the mine explosion had given the signal for attack and storm the germans who had been driven from their first two lines of trenches had made desperate efforts to get them back   there had been fierce counter attacks many times repeated but through them all the americans had stood like a rock and thrown the enemy back without yielding a foot of the conquered ground   at nightfall the enemy had ceased his infantry attacks although the big guns on both sides like angry mastiffs kept growling at each other   
it's been a great day for our fellows exulted frank as they picked their way through the welter of debris that bore testimony to the violence of the fighting   it sure has agreed bart   we've got there with both feet remarked tom and in both trenches chimed in billy   yes said frank   
i'm glad we didn't stop at the first one   the mine caught the boches napping there and stood them on their heads   but in the second it was an out and out stand up fight man to man and we licked them   and licked them good asserted billy   
i guess they won't do any more sneering at the yankees after this day's work   they passed the place where bart had so nearly met his death through the treacherous attack of his captive   here's where you nearly went west remarked tom don't talk of it objected bart with a grimace   it makes the chills creep over me to think of it   
i could stand being knifed in a square fight but i'd hate to get it the way that fellow meant that i should   one of the frenchmen was telling me of something like that that happened at verdun said frank   two frenchmen were carrying a wounded german officer on a stretcher to the hospital   the officer got out his revolver and shot the first stretcher bearer dead   
that's gratitude for you remarked bart   something like another german in a hospital who pretended he wanted to shake hands with the red cross nurse who was tending him and then with a sudden snap broke her wrist   you hear it said sometimes said billy that the only good indian is a dead indian   that's always sounded a little tough on poor lo but if the huns keep on the way they are going it won't be long before all the world will be saying that the only good german is a dead one   
i'm beginning to say it already replied tom they passed stretcher bearers carrying away the wounded and burial parties engaged in a business still more sad   there was plenty for them to do for death and wounds had come to many that day which had been the most strenuous for the united states troops since they had come to the fighting line   that many of their regiment had fallen and still more been wounded the boys knew well although the full toll of their losses would not be known until the next day   but the enemy had lost still more and a large number of prisoners were in american hands   
they had taken two trenches on a wide front and that night american boys were eating their suppers in the dugouts where germans had breakfasted in the morning   it had been a dashing attack with a successful result and uncle sam had reason to be proud of his nephews   one more step on the road to the rhine exulted frank voicing the thought that stirred them all   right you are replied bart it's a long long road but we'll get there   
do you remember what old peterson said just before we left for france    queried tom the united states has put her hand to the plow and she won't turn back   good old peterson    remarked billy   
he was a dandy scrapper himself in the old days when he wore the blue   i'll bet he's rooting for us every day   sure he is agreed frank   everybody in the old firm is   
reddy's rooting the hardest of them all laughed bart referring to the red headed office boy   do you remember how excited the little rascal got when the old thirty seventh went past    he almost tumbled out of the window   and how he cheered   
 he's got the right stuff in him said tom do you know i shouldn't be a bit surprised to see that kid turn up here some time   you're dreaming replied bart   you wait and see prophesied tom when any one wants a thing hard enough he usually gets it   he'll ship as cabin boy or something of the kind and some day when we're least expecting it reddy will pop up here   
watch my hunch   how scared the huns would be if they knew that reddy was coming to clean them up mocked tom he might account for some of them at that remarked billy   a bullet from reddy's gun would go as fast and hit as hard as any other   you know what david did to goliath   
by this time they had passed the second captured trench and were facing the enemy's trench about three hundred yards away   their talk ceased or died down to whispers   before them stretched the desolate waste of no man's land pitted with shell holes blasted and seared by the pitiless storm of fire that had swept it all that day   once it had been fertile and beautiful   
now it was withered and hideous   it was a grim commentary on the war that had been as ruthless toward nature as it had been toward man   now boys said the corporal in a low voice you know what we've got to do   keep together as much as you can and drop the last command came out like a shot and was caused by a star shell that rose from the opposing trench and burst in a flood of greenish light   
had they been standing it would have revealed them clearly but at their leader's word they had dropped instantly to the ground where they lay motionless until the light died away   then they rose and like so many shadows moved cautiously forward with a motion more like drifting than walking their ears alert their eyes strained their hearts beating fast with excitement   chapter v. the barbarous huns the night was as black as pitch which while an advantage in one way was a disadvantage in another   for though it lessened their chance of detection it also made it more difficult to get the lay of the land and keep their sense of direction   
but here again their training came into play for they had been specially drilled to be blindfolded and remain in that condition for hours at a time   in that way they had developed their sense of feeling just as a blind man does and had acquired an almost uncanny ability to avoid obstacles and steer a course without the aid of their eyes   gee    whispered bart to frank as the two comrades moved along side by side i never saw a night so dark   
yes replied his comrade it's as black as velvet   you could almost cut it with a knife   lucky if that's the only cutting we'll have to do before the night is over murmured tom soon they reached a little patch of woodland that stood almost halfway between the lines   only a few gaunt trees had been left standing mere skeletons of what they had been every branch and twig swept away by shells and bullets and even the bark stripped off leaving the trunks in ghastly nakedness   
but they still afforded shelter from bursting shrapnel or a sniper's bullet and the boys stood behind them for a few moments while they listened intently for any sound that might betray the presence of an enemy patrol prowling about on an errand similar to their own   but nothing suspicious developed and reassured they again at a signal from their leader moved forward   but new they were no longer on their feet   they were too close to the german line for that   
down on hands and knees they wormed their way along inch by inch reaching out their hand cautiously for each fresh grip on the uneven ground   sometimes their hands encountered emptiness and they were warned that they were on the edge of a shell hole   at other times they drew back in instinctive repulsion as they felt the rigid outlines of a dead body   but whatever detours they had to make they managed by touch or whisper to keep together and although their progress was slow it was still progress and they knew that they were steadily nearing the german lines   
suddenly frank's extended hand came in contact with a sharp object that he recognized on the instant   it was the barb on a broken strand of wire   they had reached the entanglement protecting a segment of the german trench   frank had been a trifle in advance of his comrades and he softly signaled his discovery to the others   
in an instant they had stiffened out and lay as rigid as statues   for five minutes not one of them stirred while they listened for the tread of the sentry who might be stationed behind the wires   some distance off they could hear the sound of voices in guttural tones the occasional click of a bayonet as it was slipped into place the low rumble of what might have been field pieces being moved into position   now too their eyes came into play for ahead of them the darkness was threaded with a faint ray of light that rose above the trench and while it did little more than make darkness visible it was still sufficient to form a background against which they could have detected the figure of a sentinel   
but they drew no false assurance from that fact for the enemy's patrol might be lying on the ground as silent as themselves and as watchful ready to fire in the direction of the slightest sound   it was a nerve trying situation but life or death might depend on their self control and they stood the test successfully although poor tom had an almost irrepressible desire to sneeze in conquering which he almost broke a blood vessel   convinced at last that it was safe to move they commenced to crawl along the outside of the wire trying by the sense of touch to find out what havoc had been made in it by the american artillery fire and where it would be easiest to break through   they had drawn on rubber gloves for they knew that the germans sometimes charged the wires with electricity and a touch with the bare hand would mean instant death   
but that day the fighting had been so fierce and the enemy had been kept so busy in resisting the american onslaught that no such precaution had been taken   and this better than anything else told the boys how badly the enemy had been shaken   at several places they found gaps that had been made by the yankee guns and these they widened by the use of the wire cutters that they carried in their belts   at each such breach the boys tied small pieces of white rag so that on the next day these fluttering bits of white could be seen through field glasses by the american officers and the full force of guns and men could be brought to bear against these weakened portions of the line   
they worked rapidly and silently timing their cutting with the roar of the guns that still kept up the artillery duel so that the click of the nippers would be drowned in the heavier sound   little by little in the course of the work the members of the patrol had drawn apart depending upon their ability to rejoin each other by following the line of the wire   frank found himself working on a specially tangled bit of wire that was made still more difficult of handling because it was intertwisted with the stalks of a thick hedge   he had just nipped a piece of wire in two when his quick ear detected a sound on the other side of the hedge   
instantly he stiffened   every muscle became as taut as tempered steel   he scarcely seemed to breathe while his unwinking eyes tried to bore through the mass of tangled brush and wire to see what was on the other side   there too the rustling sound had ceased and a silence prevailed as deep as his own   
for minutes that seemed ages this condition persisted   then slowly so slowly that frank at first was not sure that he saw aright a slender spear like point broke the outline of the top of the hedge   only the fact that it stood out against the dim light that came from the enemy trench enabled frank to see it at all   gradually the object rose higher until it seemed to broaden out at the base and then with a quickening of the pulse frank realized that what he saw was the spike of a german helmet   
 he had won in the duel of silence   the other unable to stand the strain had risen first   would he win in the grimmer duel that seemed to be impending    frank's fingers stole toward his revolver but stopped before they reached it   
there must be no shooting so near the enemy trench   a horde of germans would be upon him in a twinkling   his rifle lay beside him where he had placed it while working on the wire   his fingers closed upon the stock   
here was a weapon that he might use at either end with deadly effect   the butt could serve as a club while the bayonet painted black like the rest of his accoutrements so that no glimmer of steel should betray it carried death on its point   now beneath the helmet the head of a man appeared then the shoulders and finally the sentry evidently satisfied that his suspicion had been without foundation straightened out to his full length   he stood for another minute or two peering into the darkness   
but frank's black clad form merged so perfectly into its surroundings and he remained so motionless that the german at last was convinced   with a grunt of satisfaction he stooped to pick up his rifle   lithe as a panther frank sprang to his feet leaped over the hedge and landed heavily on the stooping form knocking the breath out of the german's body   in a flash frank's sinewy hands were upon the sentry's throat stifling the cry that sought to issue from his lips   
there was a brief struggle but the attack had been so sudden and tremendous that it was soon over and the german lay limp and unconscious   the instant frank realized this he relaxed his hold   he tore open the man's coat felt for his heart and found that it was still beating   what his foe would have done if the case had been reversed frank knew perfectly well   
a dagger point would have pierced his heart and stilled its beating forever   more than once he had looked on the bodies of comrades who had been butchered while lying wounded and helpless on the battlefield and had been stirred by a wild desire to take similar vengeance on those who had violated all the laws of war   but he was an american with all the proud traditions of honor and chivalry that had come down to him through generations   he could not slaughter a helpless foe   
he had the man a prisoner   it was enough   quickly he tied the sentry's hands using the german's own belt as a strap   then he tore some strips from the white cloth he had been carrying to fasten on the bushes and made a gag in case the man should recover his senses and try to give the alarm   
he dragged the man through a gap in the hedge so that he would not be found by any of his comrades who might come that way   then he crept down to where the corporal and the other members of the patrol were still busy on the wires and in a whisper told what had happened   wilson was quick to see the opportunity that the capture had afforded   good work sheldon he commended   
here's where we get through the wires   and we've got to do it quickly for we don't know at what time that fellow's relief may be coming along   his prophecy seemed about to be fulfilled with startling suddenness for even while he spoke a group of several figures topped by helmets was revealed by the action of one of them in striking a match   it flared up brightly for a second but luckily the boys were outside the zone of light that it formed   
they lay perfectly still although each of them took a tighter grasp on his rifle   the men conversed in guttural tones for several minutes that seemed as many ages to the watchers in the shadows   would the germans come toward them or walk away from them    their lives or at the least their liberty might depend upon the answer   
one of the men pointed in their direction and even took a step forward but his comrades stopped him and an animated discussion ensued which finally resulted in their retracing their steps in the direction from which they had come   a sigh of relief went up from the boys and their grip on their weapons relaxed   a mighty close shave whispered billy   it was all of that agreed bart   
as close for them as it was for us said tom grimly   i had that big fellow picked out and i'd have dropped him sure   like so many ghosts the party drifted along in corporal wilson's wake until they came to the gap   a glance at the motionless sentry showed that he had not yet returned to consciousness   
that was a knockout for fair murmured billy admiringly   he must have thought a house was falling on him whispered bart with a low chuckle   frank's no featherweight agreed tom i'd hate to have those trench clogs of his come down on my back with him inside of them   a warning s. sh from the corporal brought them back to the grim business still before them and they crept along behind him as he wormed his way through the breach   
camp utensils were scattered upon the ground and indicated that a field kitchen had stood there recently an impression that became a conviction when bart burned his hand by bringing it down upon some smoldering embers covered with ashes   he bit his tongue trying to repress the exclamation that leaped to his lips but he succeeded although his fingers were badly blistered   little by little with many pauses they reached the edge of a small section of the first trench   nothing hindered them no one challenged them   
in fact their progress was so free from obstacles that the corporal a wily veteran who had had long experience among the savage moros while serving in the philippines became uneasy fearing an ambush   still that was one of the chances that the party had to take and there was nothing to do but to keep on   but they redoubled their precautions every sense tingling with watchfulness against a sudden surprise   they worked their way along the trench until they reached the entrance   
no sound came from the interior   they listened for the murmur of conversation the scraping of feet the clank of a weapon   they looked down its length for a ray of light   not a gleam or a sound rewarded them   
as far as they could judge it was absolutely deserted   but on the other hand it might be bristling with armed men waiting in a stillness as deathlike as their own the command to fire   for fully ten minutes their watch continued   then the corporal gathered them close around him and gave his commands in a whisper   
we'll raid it he decided   there are only a few of us but we'll have the advantage of surprise   that is if they're not waiting to surprise us   but we'll have to gamble on that   
it's only a connecting trench and there won't be more than a dozen men or thereabouts in it   if we could bag them and take them back to camp it would be a good night's work   have your guns ready and be prepared to slip them a few grenades if we have to   i'll lead the way and when the time comes i'll flash my light   
come along now and be right on your toes when i give the word   corporal wilson went first and his scouting party followed close on his heels   it was like going into the jaws of death   it would have taken less nerve to face a charge for then their blood would have been up and they would have been fired by the sight of their enemy   
there would have been nothing of this eerie stillness this vault like chill   yet not one of them hesitated or lagged behind   twenty paces had been covered when the corporal stopped drew out his flashlight and sent out a stream of radiance that illumined every nook and cranny of the trench   on the instant the boys had their rifles at their shoulders with their fingers on the triggers ready for a volley   
but their precaution was needless   the trench was empty    empty as far as men were concerned   but it was full of other things that made their hair stand up with horror as their meaning swept in upon them   
 chapter v.i. a taste of cold steel planted at intervals in the trench were rows of iron stakes coming to a sharp point at the top and cunningly camouflaged so that they would not be detected by any one looking over the edge   the army boys were not slow in seeing the meaning of the trap and the fiendish ingenuity that had conceived it   it's a dummy trench    murmured corporal wilson   
the idea is to have their men seem to retreat into it when the fighting takes place on this part of the line   our boys come on in pursuit jump over the edge come down on these sharp stakes and are spitted like larks   nice way to wage war that    it's worthy of the hun growled tom and when you've said that you've reached the limit observed bart   
the turks are pretty good at torture murmured frank bitterly but they must feel like thirty cents when they compare themselves with their german masters   let's get these things out of the way said billy wrathfully as he grasped one of the spikes   but the corporal stopped him instantly   don't dig them out   
 he cried   there's no knowing but what you may cause an explosion   or they may have some electric connection that will give warning to the boches   we've spotted the location of this infernal trap and that's enough   
our officers will see that our men steer clear of it   of course remarked bart all the value to the huns of this trap depends upon our boys jumping in from the top of the trench   if they came in from the entrance to the dugout all the trouble of planting these spikes would be thrown away   it would be a trap just the same only in a different way replied the corporal   
it's a safe bet that the germans have machine guns planted where they can sweep the whole length of this part of the trench   they'd wait until our boys were all crowded in here and then the machine guns would start spitting and wipe every last one of them out   there'd be no way to get put except the way they had come in and no one could get through that storm of bullets   but now let's get out of this while the going's good   
the conversation had been carried on in the faintest whispers and after the first hurried examination of the dummy trench there had been no light   but they all felt better when they had passed out of the trench without mishap and lay on the ground above   here they were at least in the open and if death came to them they would not be slaughtered like rats in a trap   the corporal consulted his radio watch and found that it wanted but two hours to dawn   
not much time left boys he murmured   and unless we get back to our lines before daylight we'll stand a good chance of losing the number of our mess   but if we don't do anything else we've done a pretty fair night's work   the finding of this dummy trench will put a crimp in the heinies' plans   
i'd like to have some prisoners to take along just for luck but all we've bagged is that sentry   perhaps we haven't even got him suggested frank   some of his comrades may have found him by this time   not likely replied bart   
he couldn't make a noise and as we left him outside the wire they wouldn't be likely to stumble over him   all the same we'd better get a hustle on replied the corporal and they started on their homeward journey as stealthily as they had come   they had some difficulty in finding the breach in the wire through which they had entered but at last they succeeded and wormed their way out   then they felt around for the sentry and found him in the place they had left him   
he had returned to consciousness for when the corporal risked a ray of his flashlight on the upturned face they could see that his eyes were open and looking at them intelligently   the corporal placed the muzzle of his revolver against the man's neck as a gentle reminder of what would happen to him if he should make a sound and they proceeded to untie his hands   then they motioned to him that he was to get on his hands and knees and go before them which with muffled grunts and after two or three attempts he succeeded in doing   he was evidently dazed yet and stiff from the cramped attitude in which he had been lying but stern necessity was on him and he finally wobbled and staggered on before them   
they had got some little distance away from the wires when frank suddenly came to a dead stop   his comrades halted instantly   what is it    whispered wilson who was nearest to him   
that blur ahead of us returned frank   it looks a little more solid than the rest of the darkness   he pointed ahead and a little to the right   i don't see anything remarked tom neither do i affirmed billy   
i think i see a little blacker patch than usual declared bart   and it seems to be moving   the corporal put his ear to the ground   i think sheldon is right he said after a moment of intense listening   
at any rate we'll take no chances   slip into some of these shell holes and lie low   if it should be an enemy patrol and there are too many to tackle we'll let them go by   but if there aren't more than double our number we'll take a crack at them   
keep your weapons ready and let fly when i give the word   the ground was so pitted with craters from the heavy artillery duel that had been raging all the day before that they had no difficulty in finding shelter   their prisoner who judged by the preparations that some of his own comrades were approaching was inclined to balk a little and delay matters but a vigorous push of bart's boot hastened his movements and he was tumbled in unceremoniously   and they blessed the precaution that had still left the gag in his mouth when they had unfastened his hands   
more and more the blur ahead of them detached itself from the surrounding darkness until even skeptical tom and billy knew that what they saw was a body of men bearing down steadily in their direction   of course there was a chance that it was an american patrol out on an errand similar to their own but it was unlikely if that were so that they would be going in the direction of the enemy's lines when the night was so far spent   nearer and nearer came the party until not more than thirty feet lay between them and the american boys who knelt in the shell holes with faces stern and set and fingers on the triggers of their rifles awaiting the word of command   but for some unknown reason the blur became motionless and remained so for several minutes   
then it receded as though the party had changed its plan   what do you suppose is the matter with them    whispered tom do you think they've tumbled to our being here    how could they   
 returned frank   they'd have to have the eyes of cats to see us in these holes   i hope the corp will let us go after them murmured billy   i'm all tuned up for a scrap   
wilson hesitated   if he went after the supposed enemy they would probably hear him and he would lose the advantage of the surprise   on the other hand that they now seemed to be going in the direction of the american lines might indicate that after all they were a patrol of his own comrades   but while he weighed the chances the question was solved for him by the fact that the blur again became distinct   
and this time it grew larger very rapidly indicating that the party had at last reached a definite decision   on they came until only a few paces separated them from the army boys   just then a star shell rose from the german lines and sent a flare of light stabbing the darkness and clearly revealing a dozen or more germans   as they were facing the glare they were momentarily dazzled by it and the americans peering beneath their black hoods on a level with the ground could have easily escaped detection had they been so inclined   
but that instantaneous flash had decided the corporal   the odds were more than two to one but such odds as that was only a challenge to yankee fighting blood   fire    he shouted and five rifles spoke as one   
three of the enemy went down as though stricken by an axe and another staggered and his rifle clattered to the ground   but the enemy rallied almost instantly and at a hoarse command there was a return volley   this proved harmless however for the boys knew that it would come and bent beneath the edge of the craters until the iron storm had swept over them   now boys at them with your bayonets   
 shouted corporal wilson as soon as he had drawn the enemy's fire   with a leap the american squad was on the level ground and rushing with leveled bayonets at the foe   the americans had the advantage of the surprise and their headlong charge would have won instantly if the forces had been equal   but although two went down at once the others after yielding ground somewhat closed in a death grip with their assailants and there was a furious combat at close quarters   
there was no more shooting   it was a matter now of clubbed rifles and bayonet thrusts   frank found himself engaged in a bayonet duel with a massive german who towered above him in height and probably outweighed him by twenty pounds   he was well trained too in bayonet work and was a most formidable opponent   
but he met his master when he crossed bayonets with frank   the latter had made himself expert by long training under skilful french instructors and besides was the most finished boxer in the regiment   at thrust and parry feint and riposte advance and retreat he stood first among his comrades   against the furious bull like rushes of his opponent he opposed a quickness and agility that more than counterbalanced his enemy's weight it was a contest of a bull against a panther and the panther won   
for perhaps two minutes the fight continued   then with a lightning thrust frank's bayonet found its mark and the german staggered for a moment fell headlong and lay still   his fall seemed to take the heart out of the others who were being outfought and pressed back   they wavered broke and started to flee but the sharp crack of the corporal's revolver brought one of them to the ground and the others halted   
up went their hands and from the lips of each came the cry kamerad in token of surrender   the american boys rounded them up and disarmed them   then the corporal took account of stock   bart was there panting and flushed with nothing worse than a scalp wound where a rifle butt had glanced from his head   
wilson himself was unhurt   billy also had come through unscathed but tom was nowhere to be seen   an awful fear a fear that they had never felt in the fighting itself clutched the hearts of his comrades   good old tom bound to them by a thousand ties of friendship and comradeship had he met his fate in this desolate stretch of no man's land   
 frantically they searched among the bodies for one that wore a suit similar to their own   frank found it first   his hand went to the heart and to his joy found that it was beating   he lifted tom's head and rested it on his knee   
tom    tom    he called as he chafed his chum's hands and loosened his suit at the throat   tom's eyes slowly opened and recognizing his friend a faint smile came to his lips   
but he did not speak and bart who was the only other one who could be spared from guarding the prisoners joined frank in redoubled efforts to bring tom back to full consciousness   he doesn't seem to have any bones broken said frank after a hurried examination   and he isn't bleeding replied bart   but he has a lump on his head as big as an egg   
at last tom's full consciousness returned and with his chums' assistance he got slowly and painfully to his feet   guess they haven't got my number yet but they came mighty near it he said trying to grin   i'd just run one of the huns through the arm when i saw another out of the tail of my eye swinging for my head with his rifle   i tried to dodge but he must have been too quick for me for that's the last i remember   
thank heaven it was no worse    ejaculated frank fervently   it would have been a mighty bad thing for us if you had cashed in old boy said bart with feeling   how did the scrap turn out   
 asked tom though i suppose there's no use in asking or you wouldn't be here taking care of me   we trimmed them good and proper said frank from whom a ton's weight had been lifted by finding that his friend had escaped serious injury   a lovely scrap added bart   i wouldn't have missed it for a farm   
we've wiped out five and rounded out the rest   let's go over and see how many there are   eight announced the corporal as he counted the prisoners who stood in a group sullen and morose   there must have been a baker's dozen in the party   
i don't know how superstitious they may be chuckled billy but i'll bet that from now on they'll agree that thirteen is an unlucky number    chapter v.i.i. nick rabig's queer actions well remarked corporal wilson who was relieved beyond measure to find that his own little force was practically intact eight is a pretty good bag for one night's work not to speak of five more who won't do any more strafing for the kaiser   nine corrected bart   don't forget our speechless friend in the shell hole   
no doubt he'd be perfectly willing to be forgotten grinned billy   but we'd better take him along just for luck   that'll be nearly two prisoners apiece for each of the bunch   pretty fair work if you ask me   
there was no further time for talking for it would soon be dawn and they were eager to get back to their own lines   they had been under a terrible strain through all the long hours of the night and were beginning to feel the reaction   and they were not at all averse to showing their comrades in the regiment how well they had fared and how stoutly they had held up the colors of the old thirty seventh who goes there    came the sharp challenge of the sentry as they drew near the american trench and they knew that a score of rifles was trained upon them to back up the sentry's demand if the answer were halting or suspicious   
friends replied the corporal   advance and give the countersign was the next requirement   corporal wilson complied and he and his squad were joyfully welcomed   i said friends' added the corporal with a grin as the party made their way through the opening in the wire defences but perhaps that doesn't go for all this crowd   
some of them didn't want to come but we told them they'd better and here they are   a bunch of huskies remarked the sentry as he surveyed the prisoners critically   you don't mean to say that just you five rounded up that gang    the four privates merely grinned   
looks like it doesn't it    answered the corporal with keen relish of the sentry's surprise   counting those we brought down there are just fourteen that will turn up missing when the boches call the roll this morning   that's going some said the sentry admiringly   
i only wish i'd been along with you   some fellows have all the luck   the prisoners were turned over to the officer in charge and the corporal made his way to headquarters to make his report of the night's work   bart and tom went under the hands of the surgeons to have their wounds and bruises treated and were assured that with a little rest they would be as well as ever in a day or two   
then the boys dog tired as bart expressed it but happy and exultant that they had done their work well and were back safe once more tumbled into their bunks to enjoy the rest they had so richly earned   never was so tired in my life murmured frank drowsily as he fell rather than climbed into his bunk   same here chimed in billy   rip van winkle won't have anything on me drawled tom what's twenty years of sleep   
 i'm going to take forty   as for bart he started to say something but dropped off to sleep while saying it   none of the quartette woke until late in the afternoon   then they found that their exploit had made a stir in the regiment   
their fight against twice their number was the most interesting feature to their comrades of the rank and file   but still more important in the view of their officers was the discovery of the dummy trench which might have been turned into a shambles for the american troops if they had rushed into the trap so cunningly and so fiendishly set for them   it was fine work corporal the captain said warmly when wilson finished his report   you deserve credit for having brought your squad back without the loss of a man   
they mostly brought themselves back sir replied wilson with a smile   it's a pleasure to command such a nervy crowd as that   you don't need to use the spur   i'm mostly busy putting on the brakes   
it would have done your heart good if you could have seen the way they waded into the huns   that fellow sheldon particularly is a crackerjack when it comes to a scrap   he's as strong as an ox and as quick as a cat   i've had my eye on him replied the officer   
he'll go far before the war is over   you can go now corporal   i'll have your work mentioned in the order of the day   he was as good as his word for when the regiment was drawn up for inspection the order of the day commended each man of the squad by name for their gallant exploit that as the order ran reflected credit on the regiment   
how's your head feeling now old man    frank asked of tom as they rejoined each other at mess   pretty groggy responded tom but i'm not kicking   i'm lucky to be alive at all   
that fellow made an awful swipe at me and if it had hit me fair it would have been all over   a miss is as good as a mile put in bart   i had a pretty close shave myself   seemed as though twenty star shells were going off at once   
yesterday was your lucky day remarked billy   you had two narrow escapes   let's hope it won't be three times and out responded bart lightly   by the way i wonder what they did with that corporal who tried to do me up   
 most likely he's shot by this time observed tom if he isn't he ought to be   he isn't shot yet at any rate remarked fred andon who sat near by   i guess the fighting was so hot all day yesterday that they didn't have time to attend to him   likely enough he's down in the prisoners' pen waiting for the court martial let's go down and see after we've finished our chow suggested billy   
that is if you fellows ever get through eating   look at tom stowing it away   he'd eat his way through the whole quartermaster's department if he was let   and he's the fellow that they wouldn't let enlist because of his teeth gibed bart   
they didn't know tom   i'm not the only one that got a raw deal replied tom with whom it was always a sore point that he had been refused when he wanted to enlist but had been accepted in the draft   there's a drafted man here who was telling me the other day that he walked ninety miles to enlist   and do you know what the enlistment board did to him   
 what    was the query   turned him down because he had flat feet responded tom told him he wouldn't be able to stand a five mile hike   there was a roar of laughter   
i heard another good one chimed in billy   a fellow wanted to enlist and the examining board wanted to reject him because he had a cast in his eye   oh that's all right he drawled i allus shets that eye anyway when i shoot   that made them laugh and he got by   
in high spirits they finished their meal and as they were off duty for the next hour or two made their way down to that quarter of the field where the prisoners' camp was placed   behind the barrier at the point nearest them they saw one bulky captive who was munching contentedly the food that had been given him and who had none of the woe begone expression that a man in his position is commonly expected to show   see him shovel it in laughed billy   he doesn't seem to have a care in the world remarked bart   
probably glad to be behind our machine guns instead of in front of them conjectured tom hello heinie    said frank good naturedly hello yourself came the answer   do you speak english    asked frank in surprise   
a little replied the german and proceeded to prove it by answering although in rather a halting manner the questions they put to him   no he at any rate had not wanted the war   he was a skilled mechanic in one of the munition factories   there had been a strike on account of bad conditions and he had been one of the leaders   
the government had seized him and bundled him off to the front   he was glad to be captured   after the war the kaiser would see that men were born to be something else than cannon fodder   well remarked frank as they moved along there's one fellow at least that doesn't cry hoch the kaiser seems good to see it so full remarked bart with great satisfaction as he saw the large number of germans who had been captured in the fierce fighting of the day before   
if only the kaiser and the crown prince were in that bunch sighed tom that's a pleasure still to come replied frank   but where's the fellow that tried to stab bart    i don't see him anywhere   seems as though the party isn't complete without him   
they made inquiry of one of the guards   oh that one replied the guard   they've roped him out from the rest of these mavericks and given him a hut all by himself   i guess he's thinking of making his will   
i hear they're going to have him out before a drumhead in the morning   which hut is it    asked frank as his eye took in a little group of shacks at the further end of the field   that end one down by the big tree   
the guard pointed it out with the point of his bayonet   they went down in that direction and as they neared the hut saw that it was guarded by a single sentry   who's that fellow on guard    asked tom my head's so dizzy yet that i'm seeing things double   
looks rather familiar for a fact said bart   wait till he turns his head this way   the next instant the sentry turned and there was a whistle of surprise from billy   by the great horn spoon   
 he ejaculated   it's nick rabig    set a hun to watch a hun remarked tom bitingly   oh come tom remonstrated frank that's going a little too far   
i've no reason to like the fellow and we know he had to be dragged into the army but that doesn't say he's a hun   all except the uniform persisted tom he'd rather be fighting for the kaiser this minute than for uncle sam   shouldn't wonder if tom's more than half right assented billy   you know the way he used to talk in camport   
you notice that we've never seen him volunteering for any of the raiding parties said billy   but that may only mean that rabig has a yellow streak in him   it doesn't say that he's a traitor returned frank   well maybe he isn't conceded tom but all the same it seems rather queer that he should have been picked out to guard this heinie   
they could talk together in german through that closed door and nobody be wise to what they were saying   i don't suppose the officers know rabig as well as the rest of us do said billy   but say fellows look at that bit of white under the door of the hut   what do you suppose it is   
 oh just a scrap of paper laughed bart   just like the belgian treaty   something the wind's blown up against the door i guess conjectured tom wind nothing    exclaimed frank whose vision was keener than that of any of the others   
it's under the door and it's getting bigger and bigger all the time   i tell you what it is fellows he went on excitedly it's a note that's being pushed out by the fellow inside   let's get behind these trees and see what's going on suggested bart indicating a clump of trees near which they happened to be standing   in a moment they were screened from observation   
then they watched with the keenest interest what would follow   that rabig had caught sight of the paper was evident for he stopped his pacing and turned his eyes on the door   then he looked stealthily about him   the nearest sentry was some distance away and the boys were well hidden by the trees   
then rabig made a complete circuit of the little hut as though to make sure that no one was lurking about   having apparently satisfied himself on that point he returned and resumed his pacing until he was directly in front of the door   here he paused and drew out his handkerchief and wiped his forehead   but as he went to put it back it dropped from his hand so that it lay close by and almost upon the protruding piece of paper   
he was stooping to pick it up when he caught sight of a sergeant coming in his direction   instantly he straightened up and as he did so the butt of his rifle knocked against the door   the paper disappeared as though it had been drawn swiftly back from the inside just as the sergeant came up   gee   
 gasped tom prisoner all right rabig    inquired the sergeant   yes sir replied rabig   he seems to be keeping pretty quiet   
i looked in a little while ago and he was lying asleep on the bench   keep a close watch on him counseled the sergeant   what he tried to do to raymond yesterday shows that he's a desperate character   but i guess that by this time to morrow he won't need any one to watch him   
the sergeant passed on and the boys looked at each other with speculation in their eyes   what do you think of it    asked frank thoughtfully   think   
 snorted tom i think that rabig is a bad egg   what else is there for any one to think    it certainly looks suspicious said bart with a little wrinkle of anxiety creasing his brow   one thing is sure declared billy   
it was a note that was being pushed outside that door   the fellow inside was trying to get into communication with rabig   true assented frank   but that in itself doesn't prove anything   
you or i might be on sentry duty and a prisoner might try to do the same thing to us   yes agreed billy   but we wouldn't act the way rabig did   we'd have picked up the note and given it to the sergeant of the guard   
and we wouldn't have sneaked around the hut to see if any one was near by said tom why did he drop his handkerchief except to have an excuse for picking it up and copping the note at the same time    and his rifle butt didn't hit the door by accident put in billy   that was a tip to the prisoner that some one was coming   did you see how quickly the note disappeared   
 i hate to think that there's a single man in the regiment who's a disgrace to his uniform remarked frank but it certainly looks bad   that fellow rabig will bear watching   i told you he was a hun declared tom his body's in france but his heart's in germany   chapter v.i.i.i. colonel pavet reappears the army boys thought over the situation in some perplexity   
what do you suppose we ought to do    asked bart   we ought to go hotfoot to the captain and tell him what we've seen declared tom with emphasis   i hardly like to do that objected billy   
at least not at this stage of the game   after all we haven't any positive proof against nick   his handkerchief might have dropped accidentally   and the knocking of the butt of his gun against the door could have happened without his meaning anything by it   
he could explain his going around the hut by saying he wanted to be especially vigilant in guarding the prisoner   yes agreed frank we haven't proof enough against rabig to hang a yellow dog   and i wouldn't want to get him in bad with his officers on mere suspicion   that note might be proof if we could only get hold of it suggested tom swell chance   
 returned bart   you can bet that note is chewed up and swallowed by this time   the first thing the hun thought of when he was tipped off that some one was coming was to get rid of the evidence that might queer his chance of escape   i'll tell you what we'll do said frank   
we'll just go down and see rabig and ask him casually about the prisoner   that may make him think that we're on to something and if he's planning to do anything crooked it may scare him off   it won't do any harm anyway and we'll take a chance   they left the clump of trees and strolled down carelessly in the direction of the hut   
rabig saw them coming and the surly look that was habitual with him became more pronounced than usual   there was no love lost between him and any of them   he had been thoroughly unpopular in camport because of his bullying nature even before the outbreak of the war and his evident leaning toward germany had deepened this feeling   since he had been drafted he had of course kept his pro german views to himself for he valued his skin and had no desire to face a firing squad   
but his work had been done grudgingly and his disposition to shirk had more than once gained him short terms in the guardhouse   of all the group approaching him he most heartily disliked frank   in the first place frank had never permitted him to bully him when they were with moore and thomas and the two had been more than once on the brink of a fight   and since the boxing bout in the camp when he had tried foul tactics and frank had thrashed him thoroughly his venom toward his conqueror had been more bitter than ever   
the boys stopped when they reached the front of the hut   hello rabig    they greeted him   hello   
 responded rabig still keeping up his pacing   right on the job i see remarked bart pleasantly enough   your eyesight's mighty good replied nick sullenly   yes bart came back at him i can see a bit of white paper from quite a distance   
rabig gave a sudden start   what do you mean by that    he demanded   nothing special replied bart carelessly   
what should i mean    by the way put in tom you'd better tuck your handkerchief in a little more tightly or you'll lose it   it looks as though it were almost ready to drop out   what if it does   
 snarled rabig   i could pick it up again couldn't i    of course you could said tom but you might pick up something else with it   dust or a bit of paper or something like that   
say what's the matter with you guys anyway    demanded rabig glowering at them   that looks like quite a solid door remarked frank inspecting it critically   oh i don't know responded billy   
it's got dents in it   here's one that looks as though it were made by a rifle butt   rabig looked at them angrily and yet furtively evidently seeking to find out how much their remarks meant   you fellows had better get along he snapped   
you're interfering with discipline by talking to a sentry on guard   rabig's newborn reverence for discipline amused the boys so that they had hard work to repress a laugh   you're right responded frank   we'll mosey along   
ta ta rabig said bart   keep your eye peeled for any hun trick   that fellow nearly got me yesterday with his knife and he might try to play the same game on you   don't you worry growled rabig   
i can take care of myself   the chums passed on laughing and talking about indifferent things until they were out of ear shot   we've got him guessing remarked billy with a grin   we managed to put a flea in his ear agreed tom did you see how red he got   
 questioned bart   he sure is wondering how much we know summed up frank   whether it will make him go straight or not is another question   what we fellows ought to do is to take turns keeping tab on him so that he can't act crooked even if he wants to   
it's a pity there should be any men in the american army whom we have to watch said tom bitterly   yes but that's to be expected returned frank   there's never been an army in the history of the world that hasn't been infected with traitors more or less   look at benedict arnold remarked billy   
to my mind it's surprising that there aren't more said frank   that's what the kaiser was counting on   he thought that the german element in america was so strong that we wouldn't dare to go to war with him   do you remember what he told gerard   
 that there were five hundred thousand germans in america who would revolt    yes grinned billy and i remember how gerard came back at him with the five hundred thousand lamp posts on which we'd hang them if they did   they were out on the main road by this time and they stepped to one side and saluted as an officer in french uniform accompanied by an orderly came galloping along   the officer's eye swept the group as he returned the salute and when it rested on frank he drew up his horse so suddenly that the beast sat back on its haunches   
the officer threw himself from the horse's back cast the reins to his orderly and came impetuously toward the astonished army boys with his hand extended to frank   monsieur sheldon    he exclaimed his face beaming   mon brave americain   
le sauveur de ma vie   colonel pavet    cried frank with equal pleasure as he took the extended hand   yes replied the newcomer colonel pavet alive and well thanks to you   
ah i shall never forget the night when i lay wounded on the battlefield and you climbed out of the trench and made your way through a storm of bullets and shells to my side and carried me back to safety   it was the deed of a hero a modern d'artagnan    how glad i am to see you again    and i to see you responded frank warmly   
you were so dreadfully wounded that i feared you might not recover   they were talking in french which frank spoke like a native thanks to his french mother and the other boys saluted and passed on leaving the two together   if we had not met i would have searched you out went on the colonel for i have some news for you   news that both you and your mother will be glad to hear   
my mother repeated frank his eyes kindling and his heart responding as it never failed to do at the mention of that dear mother of his who in her lonely home across the sea was waiting and praying for him   chapter i.x. the escape yes replied colonel pavet your mother madame sheldon it seems strange for me to name her thus for i never think of her except as lucie de latour as i knew her in her girlhood has a very excellent prospect of coming into the property that was willed to her   i'm very glad to hear that    exclaimed frank   
and i know that my mother will be pleased too   i have told her in my letters about my meeting with you and i gave her the remembrances that you were kind enough to send her   she was delighted to know that i had met one of her old neighbors in auvergne and she asked me to thank you most heartily for your kindness in promising to look after her interests   the colonel smiled genially   
she is too good he responded   the obligation is all on my side   my humble services would have been at her disposal in any event simply for the sake of old friendship   but how much more ought they to be wholly hers now that her son has saved my life   
i am afraid you put too much value on what i did colonel said frank deprecatingly   it was something that not one in ten thousand would have done replied the colonel warmly   when i found myself helpless and wounded on that field of death i thought my life was over and i had commended my soul to god   i'm glad that you have lived to strike another blow for france said frank   
ah for france    repeated the colonel fervently as he lifted his cap reverently   as i started to say he resumed after a moment your mother's prospects for coming into her own are excellent   after my wound i was sent home and for some time it was doubtful whether i would live or die   
but god was good and i recovered   while i was gradually mending i had ample time to look into that matter of the contested will   and fortunately just at that time my brother andre who is one of the leading lawyers of paris came to the chateau to see and cheer me up while i was convalescing   i laid the whole matter before him and he went into it thoroughly   
he has gone over all the proceedings in the case and he tells me that there is no doubt that your mother has the law as well as right unfortunately they are not always the same thing on her side   he says that the testimony of those who are contesting the will smacks strongly of perjury   it is too bad that your mother cannot be here for then andre thinks the whole thing could be straightened out at once   it is too bad agreed frank but in the present state of things and the danger on the atlantic from submarines i would not want her to take the risk   
but what you say delights me as i am sure it will her and i can't thank you enough for all the trouble you have taken   not trouble but pleasure corrected the colonel   and you can be assured that the matter will not be allowed to lag now that andre has taken it up   when he starts a case he can be depended on to carry it through to a finish   
i will keep in close touch with him and will let you know from time to time how the matter is progressing   but now tell me about yourself   there's not much to tell replied frank   i'm well and have been lucky enough so far not to have stopped a bullet   
the colonel's eyes twinkled   not much to tell he repeated   no not if monsieur sheldon does the telling   but there are others who speak more freely   
your captain for instance   frank flushed uncomfortably and colonel pavet laughed outright   bravery and modesty usually go together he went on   how about that machine gun episode yesterday when an american soldier cut down its crew turned it on the enemy trench and compelled the men in it to surrender   
 how about the raiding party where five men accounted for fourteen of the huns    you see mon ami that i have a good memory for details   ah you are blushing   i wonder if you too could recall these things if you tried   
there were a lot of us in on them parried frank and one did as much as another   well rejoined the colonel i'm proud that a french woman is your mother   you have a glorious heritage in the traditions of two gallant countries   and i rejoice to see the way you americans are throwing yourselves into the fighting   
we were sorely pressed by the hun hordes and were fighting with our backs against the wall   and such fighting    returned frank enthusiastically   the world has never seen anything finer   
the spirit of france is unconquerable   yes replied the colonel proudly   as one of our great orators has said if the men are all killed the women will rise up if the women are killed the children will rise if the children are killed the very dead will rise and fight fight for france   but i must go on he continued motioning to his orderly to bring up his horse   
i have a long journey yet before i reach the headquarters of my division   i am more delighted than i can tell that i met you as i did   may we meet again soon   in berlin if not sooner interjected frank with a smile   
ah that is it said the colonel delightedly   in berlin    that is the way to speak   it may be a long time but sooner or later the stars and stripes and the tricolor will wave together unter den linden may heaven speed the day   
 the french officer wrung frank's hand warmly sprang into the saddle and with frank's bon voyage ringing in his ears galloped rapidly away   twilight was coming on as frank set out to rejoin his comrades who were waiting for him at a little distance down the road   his heart was light for he had news to write his mother that he knew would bring her pleasure   some swell chaffed tom as frank came up to his friends   
talking to a colonel as though he were a pal   i wonder that you condescend to talk to us common privates   it is a comedown grinned frank but i'll try to tolerate you for a while longer   but say fellows that colonel is a brick   
 not a bit of side about him   and he's doing a lot for us in the matter of my mother's property that i've told you about   that's bully    exclaimed bart heartily   
i'll forgive him conceded tom magnanimously even if he does talk in a lingo that i can't understand   why i thought you were a finished french scholar by this time chaffed bart   do you remember the day tom tried to ask for soup and got his tongue twisted around bouillon    gibed billy with a broad grin   
well i got the soup anyway didn't i    defended tom sure you got it agreed billy   i could hear you getting it   tom made a pass at him that billy ducked   
talking about soup makes me hungry remarked bart   if you fellows stand talking here much longer we'll be late at chow   i'd like to have one more look at that hut rabig's guarding said frank a little uneasily   we might stroll down this way again after supper if you like suggested billy but just at present a little knife and fork exercise seems the most pressing business i have to attend to   
just then their talk was interrupted by a single shot followed by a volley of them and looking back in the direction from which they had come they saw men running in the direction of the hut that rabig had been guarding   they turned and ran at full speed and were soon in the midst of an excited group gathered about the hut   what's up    asked frank of one of the soldiers   
prisoner escaped replied the other briefly   what prisoner    the fellow that rabig was guarding   some way or other he got out managed to strike rabig down and skipped   
poor rabig's pretty badly messed up   the boys looked at each other   poor rabig repeated tom and there was a world of meaning in his tone   chapter x. a ghastly burden the sergeant of the guard came running up quickly followed by two other officers of higher rank and a hurried inquiry took place on the spot   
rabig had been lifted to his feet from where he had been lying and stood supported by two comrades   blood was running down his face from a wound in his head   he seemed weak and dazed although a surgeon who had been hastily summoned pronounced the wound not dangerous   he seemed to have been dealt a glancing blow and as in the case of all scalp wounds the blood had flowed freely   
bring a seat for him commanded the lieutenant in charge and the order was promptly obeyed   now rabig proceeded the officer not unkindly tell me about this   how did you come to lose your prisoner    rabig looked about him in a helpless sort of way   
i don't know he mumbled   my head is swimming so that i can't remember   try to think said the officer patiently   rabig seemed to make an effort but did not succeed and fell back in a swoon that put an end for the present to the questioning   
who saw anything of this    queried the lieutenant looking about him   does any one know in what direction the prisoner went    if you please sir said one of the sentries who had been guarding an adjacent hut i saw a man jump on a horse and go through the woods there but it was getting dark and i didn't know but what it might be one of our own men   
but i ran up here and found rabig lying on the ground and the door of the hut was open   i sent a shot after the man on horseback and so did some of the other men but we couldn't take aim and i don't know whether we hit him or not   look alive there commanded the officer   sergeant take a squad of men and beat up these woods   
the fellow may be hiding there   take him dead or alive   yes sir replied the sergeant saluting   the soldiers standing by were hastily sent into the woods and others were summoned to join them   
the prisoner had got a good start but by this time the field telephones were busy all along the line and his chance of ultimate escape was by no means bright   but he was a powerful and desperate man and if he had any weapons at all he would probably make his capture a costly one   he'll reason that he's a dead man if we get him and he might as well die fighting remarked frank as with his comrades he picked his way through the woods   righto agreed tom and even if he didn't have a weapon when he escaped there are lots of them lying around and he won't have any trouble in picking one up   
i wonder if he'll stick to the horse mused bart   i hardly think so replied billy   he knows from the shots that were sent after him that we know he used a horse in escaping and will be looking for a man on horseback   so he'll try to deceive us by going on foot   
he'll probably hang about in the woods until it's pitch dark and then try to get through the lines said frank   he may be behind any tree or bush and we want to be mighty careful to examine each one as we go past it   maybe he'll climb a tree suggested tom looking up to the branches of one he happened to be under at the moment   not a chance at this time of the year objected billy   
there aren't any leaves to hide him and even in the darkness we could probably see his outline against the sky   then too if he were seen he could be potted too easily   no he's not up a tree   queer that he should have got away so soon after we'd been down to the hut remarked frank   
queer    snorted tom it isn't queer at all to my way of thinking   the whole thing was cut and dried   then you think that rabig was in cahoots with him   
 asked bart dubiously   i'm sure of it responded tom use your common sense fellows   we see half a dozen suspicious things that look as if rabig and the prisoner had some understanding   a little while after the prisoner escapes   
what's the answer    the answer might be several things replied frank who hated to believe evil of even his worst enemy   a lot of things are due to coincidence   it may be perfectly true that rabig was in sympathy with the german but that doesn't say that he'd go so far as to let him actually escape   
he was taking big chances with his own skin in doing it   besides there's no doubt that rabig was wounded remarked bart   that fellow seems to have given him an awful knock   he was bleeding like fury   
oh it was easy enough to arrange that answered tom unconvinced   it would have been too raw to have rabig let the fellow go and still be safe and sound   how could he explain it    he'd be brought up for court martial but a scalp wound could be easily made where it would produce the most blood and do the least harm   
but what object would rabig have in taking such chances    asked billy   the fellow had been searched and couldn't have had any money with him   no but he could have promised plenty argued tom perhaps he's told rabig that the grateful kaiser would make him rich   
how do we know that rabig wouldn't fall for that    he's got an ivory dome anyway   if there were more than two ideas in his head at one time they'd be arrested for unlawful assemblage   the boys laughed and tom went on besides how do we know but what rabig is planning to desert and wants to pave the way for a warm welcome on the other side   
 it would be easy enough to slip across while the lines are so near each other   but rabig seemed to be pretty badly hurt said billy   you saw him faint   which only proves that he is a good actor retorted tom dryly   
don't think me hardhearted fellows because i'm not   i'm always ready to give everybody his due   but i feel sure down in my heart that this thing was all fixed up beforehand and some day you'll find that i'm right   for more than two hours they kept up the search without result and the fact that they had not had their supper was forced upon them with growing insistency   
isn't there any time limit to this    grumbled bart   i'll be hunting for acorns instead of a prisoner before long   i've got a vacuum where my stomach ought to be moaned billy   
gee wouldn't i like to be streaking it for the mess room   cork up you fellows commanded frank   listen    i thought i heard something just then   
the talking ceased instantly and all stood as rigid as statues   it's a horse coming this way whispered frank after a moment of strained attention   quick fellows get behind these bushes and have your rifles ready    they crouched low and peered up a little glade that ran through the forest   
but the noise ceased as suddenly as it had begun and they began to think that their comrade had been mistaken   guess frank's been stringing us chaffed billy   he's the only one who seems to have heard anything said tom don't you worry about my hearing said frank   i tell you i heard a horse's hoofs   
perhaps the rider suspects something and is trying to get a line on us just as we're trying to get one on him   it may have been a horse all right said billy but that doesn't say he had any rider   he may be rambling around all by his lonesome and perhaps he's stopped to graze somewhere   there he goes again   
 exclaimed frank and this time every one of them heard what was undeniably the thud of a horse's hoofs   but there was a hesitation an uncertainty about the animal's movements that seemed unusual   it moved as though it had no purpose in view no guiding hand on the reins   at times the canter seemed to subside into a walk   
there was something about this unseen steed at large in the dim forest that gave the boys a most uncomfortable feeling   then suddenly a more resolute note in the sound and an increase in its volume told the listening boys that the horse was coming straight toward them   the clatter of hoofs drew nearer and they clutched their guns more tightly   soon they were able to distinguish in the gloom the outline of a horse and rider   
the man's figure loomed up huge and threatening and they felt sure that it was the big german corporal for whom they were searching   the boys waited until the horse was almost upon them and then rushed out into the road   halt    cried frank   
he seized the horse's rein while the others leveled their rifles at the rider   the horse reared in fright but the rider made no answer nor did he attempt to draw a weapon   get down    commanded frank   
we've got you covered   surrender   still the rider remained silent   frank having quieted the horse went alongside and put his hand on the man's arm   
come he began then stopped suddenly   there was a moment of utter silence and frank for the first time in his life could feel the hair rising on his head   then he controlled himself   put up your rifles boys he commanded   
the man is dead    chapter x.i. with the tanks dead    exclaimed frank's comrades in voices that shook with surprise and horror   that's what i said replied frank   
touch him and see for yourselves   all did so and found that the body was rigid   how long the horse had borne his lifeless burden they could not tell   the legs were set stiffly in the stirrups and the hands had a death grip on the reins   
the boys had seen death in many forms   scarcely a day had passed since their arrival at the front without that sad experience   but it had never seemed so ghastly or uncanny as at this moment   that silent colossal figure seated bolt upright worked fearfully on their imaginations and seemed far more formidable than any living enemy would have seemed   
one of those bullets that the sentries sent after him must have reached him said bart in an awed voice   i suppose so replied frank   but it doesn't matter now   our search is over   
what are we going to do with the body    asked billy soberly   i guess we can't do anything just now replied frank   i don't think we could get those reins out of his hands anyway and i for one don't want to try   
besides this is the proof for the officers that the prisoner hasn't escaped   they're anxious because they don't know what information he might have been carrying back to the german lines   the only thing to do is for one of us to lead the horse with its rider back to camp   this seemed to the others the solution of the problem although the task was a gruesome one and they would have gladly evaded it if they could   
it made chills run down the spine to trudge along leading the horse with that huge figure towering behind them in the darkness mocking at them because he had escaped to the silent land from which they could never bring him back   but there was comfort in numbers and what no one of them could perhaps have done singly they finally accomplished by taking turns keeping close together all the while as the ghostly cavalcade wound its way through the woods   it was with a sigh of heartfelt relief that they finally drew up before the friendly lights of the regimental headquarters that had never before seemed so welcome   their coming caused a great sensation and there was soon a dense crowd around them for the uncanny circumstances of their return spread through the camp like wildfire   
the reins were cut from the dead hands and the body lifted to the ground   then after making a full report the boys went to their quarters   they were besieged with inquiries by curious comrades but they shook them off as soon as possible   their experience had been one that they were only too anxious to forget   
i don't think i want any supper after all remarked tom to his friends   same here responded bart   i don't feel as though i'd ever be hungry again   all i want to do is to get to sleep and forget it said billy   
that is if i can get to sleep   you'll sleep all right observed frank but i wouldn't guarantee you against nightmare   but harrowed as their nerves had been they were too young and healthy to stand out against the sleep they needed and when they woke the next morning both their spirits and their appetites were as good as usual   life at the front was too full of work and rush for any one experience to leave its imprint long   
their first inquiry after breakfast was for rabig   how's rabig getting along    frank asked of fred anderson   oh he's all right i guess answered fred carelessly   
when the doctors came to examine him they found that the wound didn't amount to much   said he'd be all right in a day or two   is he under arrest    asked tom why yes i suppose he is answered fred   
but i guess it's a mere form   the fact that the prisoner didn't finally get away will count in his favor   it's like baseball   an error is an error but if the man who ought to be out at first gets put out when he tries to steal second the error is harmless   
it's no credit to rabig that a bullet got the man he let escape but it's lucky for him just the same   it was evident that anderson had no suspicion that rabig had been guilty of anything but carelessness and the boys carefully refrained from saying anything about what they had gathered from their observation the day before   but when they were alone together they had no hesitation about speaking their minds   some fellows could commit murder and get away with it grumbled tom cheer up you old grouch chaffed billy   
at any rate the prisoner didn't escape and so there's no harm done   and if rabig is guilty he's got nothing from it but a sore head put in bart   i don't feel dead sure that rabig helped him said frank and yet the more i think it over the more i'm inclined to think that tom is right about it   still rabig's entitled to the benefit of the doubt   
i know how the scotch jury felt when they brought in the verdict not guilty but don't do it again   that's just what i'm afraid rabig will do said tom this time luckily it didn't matter   the prisoner didn't escape   but if rabig is a traitor how do we know but what the next time he might do something that might cause a defeat   
 it does make one uneasy agreed bart   nick in the regiment is like a splinter in the finger   it makes you sore   but we'll keep our eyes open and the very next crooked move he makes it will be curtains for him   
or taps added billy   the fighting now had lost the first intensity that had signalized the day of the mine explosion   the germans had been strongly reinforced and had held their third line which had now become their first   and they've got plenty of other lines behind that one commented tom as he sat on a trench step cleaning and oiling his rifle   
slathers of them assented billy   i suppose they stretch all the way back to the rhine   it will be some job to root them out of them if we have to storm each one of them in turn remarked bart   we don't have to count on that said frank confidently   
the allies gained twenty five miles at a clip when they drove hindenburg back from the somme   the huns may stand out a long while but when the time comes they may collapse all at once like the deacon's one hoss shay   the americans in the meantime had thoroughly reorganized the captured positions and had held them against a number of strong counter attacks but these became fewer as they failed to produce results and although the artillery still kept on growling and barking the wearied infantry had a chance to get some of the rest they so sorely needed after their herculean efforts   nothing to do till to morrow yawned billy as after performing their turn of trench duty they found themselves with an hour or two on their hands   
let's take a little hike back of the lines and see what's doing suggested bart   i think there's something in the wind connected with the tanks remarked frank   they say there's a bunch of them coming up from all parts of the front and getting together just back of our division   they're hot playthings all right commented tom they certainly keep the huns on the jump   
if we only had enough of them we might roll right into berlin   they passed some of the field batteries where the men stripped to the waist were serving the guns running the shells in and discharging their weapons with marvelous smoothness speed and precision   this is the life chaffed tom you fellows have a picnic here away back of the lines while we chaps in the front line do all the work and stop all the bullets   g'wan you doughboys retorted a gunner good naturedly if we're alive here after eight days the orders are to shoot us for loafing   
a little further on they came upon a myriad of tanks of all descriptions   there were baby tanks whippets male and female all with different functions to perform during a battle   just as in the navy there are vessels of all sizes from a light scout to a super dreadnought so already this arm of the service was developing various grades each to do some special work for which the others were not so well adapted   see how they're hidden said frank as he pointed to a very forest of bushes and branches that extended above the array of tanks   
that's to keep the boche aviators guessing observed bart   they'd give their eyes if they could only spy out where these fellows are being massed   i heard one of the fellows say that the tanks travel only at night so that the boches can't track them said tom and see what a raft of them have been got together here said billy   i tell you fellows there's something big going to be pulled off before long   
say boys see who's here    exclaimed frank and they turned to see will stone coming toward them with a broad smile of welcome on his bronzed face   chapter x.i.i. breaking through there was a rush toward will stone and in a moment the army boys were shaking hands with a vigor that showed the pleasure they felt at again meeting their acquaintance who belonged to the tank division   say fellows have a heart will grinned   
i need these hands in my business   but it sure does me good to see you again   and all of you alive and kicking    i'll bet that's more than some of the huns are that you've run up against   
oh we're still able to sit up and take nourishment laughed frank   but tell us about yourself old man   you look like ready money   i see you have a marking different from what you had when we saw you last remarked bart looking at the insignia that proclaimed will an officer   
and look at that war cross    cried tom i guess you've been some busy little bee to get that   shake again old scout   stone flushed and looked a little embarrassed   
only a few little skirmishes here and there he said deprecatingly   but the real big thing is yet to come   look at this army of tanks   we've never had so many in one place since the war began   
looks like a herd of elephants commented frank as his eye ran along the array that seemed to number hundreds   they'll do more trampling than any herd of elephants that ever trod the earth remarked stone grimly   but come along fellows and let me show you my own particular pet   it's the biggest one of the bunch and it's a peach   
 we call it jumbo and it carries a crew of twenty men   they followed him till they came to a monster tank on which stone placed his hand caressingly   isn't it a beauty    he asked as he beamed upon them   
i should call it a holy terror grinned frank   what the huns will call it won't be fit for publication laughed billy   i guess they've already exhausted the german vocabulary chuckled stone   but just wait until this beauty of mine goes climbing over their trenches and smashing their pill boxes and tearing away their entanglements   
then they'll know what they're up against   i only wish we could see you while you're doing it remarked tom likely enough you will replied stone   from things i've picked up here and there i think the infantry will be right alongside of us in the next big jamboree   don't you fellows make any mistake about it there's going to be one of the biggest stunts of the war pulled off in the course of the next few days   
mithridates with his elephants won't be a circumstance to us with our tanks   there sure is bound to be some lovely fighting   let it come    exclaimed tom and come quickly chimed in frank   
the only thing i'm sorry for is that you're in the canadian contingent said bart   i want to see you leading the way in a u. s. a tank   you may yet replied stone   uncle sam will soon be sending over his tanks and you bet when they do come they'll be lallapaloozers with all the modern improvements and then some   
 and the minute that happens i'm going to apply to be transferred to the united states army   these canadians are among the finest men in the world and they're doing magnificent fighting but still i'll feel more natural when i'm fighting under the stars and stripes   well that won't be long now replied frank   our men and our guns and our tanks and everything else we need to lick the kaiser will be coming in droves pretty soon   
and then watch our smoke   right you are agreed stone enthusiastically   then as a trumpet rang out he added that's the signal for a rehearsal fellows and i'll have to get on the job   we're going to put our machines through their paces   
i'm mighty glad to have seen you again and i wish you no end of luck   come over to our line when you get a chance and see the way our boys are shaping up was frank's invitation which was echoed heartily by the others   you bet i will responded stone as with a wave of his hand he went to his work while the boys strolled back to their quarters   he's the real stuff commented frank   
all wool and a yard wide   he'd rather fight than eat observed tom if the canadians take him as a sample no wonder they're glad to see uncle sam mix in remarked billy   some days went by days of steady rush and preparation   it was evident that some big operation was near at hand   
troops were moved up from other portions of the long line that stretched from switzerland to the sea   there were the bronzed tommies in khaki the snappy dashing poilus in their uniforms of corn flower blue veterans hardened in a score of battles from ypres to verdun   and right alongside of them in closest comradeship and gallant rivalry were the stalwart sons of the united states of america the very flower of her youth who had already had their baptism of fire and who had sworn to themselves that no flag should be further in the van than old glory when it came to the stern test of battle   nearer and nearer the tanks had crept to the front of the line and taken up their places in front of great openings that had been made in the wire entanglements and skilfully concealed from the enemy   
a certain number of them were assigned to lead each regiment and the camport boys' delight was great when they saw that jumbo with a squad of assisting tanks had been told off to lead their regiment   just what the doctor ordered exulted frank when he saw stone step out of the door of the monster tank   we'll follow you old man till the cows come home called bart as the boys crowded around the young operator   we'll try to make a broad path for you laughed stone as he returned their greeting cordially   
when is the show coming off    asked billy   almost any time now i guess replied stone   about all we need is a nice misty morning   
it's up to the weather sharps to tip us off   then we'll amble over and give the huns a little shaking up   several days passed with the weather exasperatingly clear   usually the soldiers would have welcomed the bright sunny mornings   
but now when they were keyed up to a high pitch the one thing they longed for was a dull and lowering sky that would favor the great enterprise they had on hand   you might think the boys were a lot of grangers after a dry spell from the way they're praying for rain remarked billy as for the hundredth time he scanned the sky   remember how different it used to be when we had a baseball game on hand    laughed frank   
then a gleam of sunshine was like money from home after you'd been broke for a week   that cloud a little while ago looked as though it might have had thunder and lightning behind it observed bart but it was only a false alarm   nothing but wind like a german bulletin grinned billy stretching himself   or their u. boat prophecies added frank   
but cheer up fellows this sunshine can't last forever   there came at last just the kind of weather wanted   a soft drizzle set in at nightfall not enough to make the ground muddy but enough to make the steaming and saturated air lie heavy on the earth   everything indicated that there would be a fog at dawn   
i guess to morrow's the big day remarked frank as he looked out at the settling mists   high time grumbled tom i'd grow stale if we had to wait much longer   the regiments slept on their arms that night and an hour before dawn all were astir and in their places   there was no special artillery fire such as usually preceded big attacks   
it was given to the tanks to level the entanglements of the enemy and open up the gaps for the troops to swarm through   the hour dragged by until within ten minutes of the time appointed for the assault   then a monotonous hum filled the air as the motors of the tanks tuned up   down through the black lines of waiting soldiers the gray monsters slowly made their way passed through the gaps made in the defences and led the way into the desolate stretch of no man's land   
even to the friendly eyes that watched them there was something weird and frightful in their aspect   it was as though the huge brutes of the prehistoric world had taken form before them   even those monsters had never carried within them such death dealing power   as the sea closes in the wake of a ship the troops fell in behind the tanks and the silent procession took up the march toward the german lines   
hardly a sound beyond the labored breathing of the tanks broke the stillness   it might have been an army of ghosts   on they went and with every step the conviction grew that the surprise would be complete   no thunder broke from the enemy guns   
no fiery barrage swept the dense ranks exacting its toll of wounds and death   for once the hun was asleep   nearer and nearer   then like so many thunderbolts at a hundred different points they struck the german lines and the tanks went through   
 chapter xiii caught napping nothing could stand before the terrific impact of the war tanks   there was a grinding tearing screeching sound as wire entanglements were uprooted   these had been strengthened in every way that german cunning could invent but they bent like straws beneath the onslaught of the gray monsters   a cyclone could not have done the work more thoroughly   
there was no need now for further secrecy and with a wild yell the allied troops swarmed through the gaps sending a deadly volley before them supplemented by thousands of grenades   at the same instant the allied artillery opened up and laid a heavy barrage fire over the heads of the onrushing troops   the blow came down on the germans with crushing force   the surprise was complete   
every detail of the great drive had been mapped out with the precision of clockwork and so nicely had it been timed that on every part of the long line the shock came like a thunderbolt   a horde of germans rushed up from the trenches and poured in a great stream into the open   the earth seemed to disgorge itself   they came shouting and yelling in wild consternation their eyes heavy with sleep and their faces pallid with fear   
fear not so much of the allied troops rushing upon them   these they had faced in many battles and though they knew the mettle of their foes they were still men who could be faced on even terms   but their courage gave way when through the spectral mists they saw the wallowing monsters bearing down on them like so many juggernauts crushing tearing mowing them down as though they were insects in the path of giants   the men fled helter skelter in the wildest panic that had come upon them since the outbreak of the war   
in vain their officers shouted and cursed at them   the iron bonds of discipline snapped like threads   soldiers rushed hither and thither like ants whose hill had been demolished by a ruthless foot   many fled back toward their second line pursued by a withering blast of rifle fire that reaped a terrible harvest of wounds and death   
others rushed back into their trenches crowding and treading upon one another   but even here they were not safe from the great tanks which lumbered down into the trenches and up on the other side leaving devastation in their wake spitting out flame from the guns they carried while they themselves in their iron armor went on uninjured   not only were they frightful engines of offense but they served as well for defense of the troops that followed after them   for the first few minutes the slaughter was awful and it looked as though the whole german line would be forced to give way without putting up any resistance worthy of the name   
prisoners were rounded up by the hundreds   there was no time then to send them to the rear   so they were gathered together in the open spaces their suspenders were cut so that their trousers would slip down and entangle their legs if they tried to escape in the confusion a small guard was put over them and the tanks and the troops went thundering on toward the second line   but here the resistance began to stiffen   
the first paralysis of surprise was past   the heavy guns of the enemy opened up and from scores of machine gun nests and pill boxes came a storm of bullets   the german officers had got their troops under some semblance of control and heavy reinforcements were rushed up from the rear   from now on the allies had an awakened and powerful foe to reckon with   
but despite the sterner opposition the tanks were not to be denied   on they went as resistless as fate   their sides were reddened now and the wake they left behind them was fearful to look upon   through the second line entanglements they crashed as easily as through the first although this time they met with losses   
some had overturned and others had been struck by heavy shells and put out of action   but even though disabled the guns on one side or the other were still able to pour out their messengers of death and take savage toll of the enemy   jumbo was leading and close behind followed the boys of the old thirty seventh with frank and his chums in the van   they were fighting like young vikings their rifles empty but their bayonets and hand grenades doing deadly work   
their arms were tired by their terrific efforts but their hearts were on fire   they felt as though they were treading on air and the blood ran through their veins like quicksilver   bunker hill and gettysburg spoke through them   the traditions of a hundred glorious battlefields on which americans had fought was theirs   
now again americans were fighting fighting to avenge the murdered women and babies of the lusitania fighting to crush the most barbarous tyranny the modern world has known fighting the battle of freedom and civilization   so they fought on like demons smashing a pill box here routing out a machine gun nest there until the second line was carried   then the conquerors paused for breath   on the whole german front in that region two lines deep the line had been smashed   
that crowded hour of stark fighting had cracked the boasted invincible line of hindenburg and sent the foe flying in confusion toward their third and most formidable line   thousands of prisoners and scores of guns were among the spoils of victory   and the most gratifying feature of the drive was the insignificant loss to the allied forces   the resistance at first had been only slight and even in the second phase of the battle it had been so quickly overcome that few of the attacking troops had fallen   
seldom had so great an advance been made at so small a price   but modern warfare has its limits in the matter of time and speed   the very swiftness with which they had advanced had in itself an element of danger because it had brought them too far ahead of their supporting guns   these had to be brought up from the rear and the captured positions had to be reorganized   
the troops too had to be given a breathing spell for they had reached the limit of human endurance   so a halt was called and the wearied men took turns in resting and refreshing themselves for the hard work that still lay ahead of them   a mighty good morning's work panted frank as he threw himself down at the roots of a giant tree which had been utterly stripped of branches and even of bark by the tempest of fire that had raged around it   ask a german and see if he'd agree with you said billy with a grin   
we've got plenty to ask said tom as his eyes roved over the throng of prisoners   we sure have taken a raft of them this morning   and there's a still bigger bunch that will never answer roll call again   there was food in plenty but they did not have to avail themselves of the rations they carried in their kits   
there were the camp kitchens of the enemy that in a twinkling were set to work and soon the savory odors of steaming stews and fragrant coffee filled the smoke laden air and brought joy to the hearts of the victors   frank bart billy and tom were lucky enough to stumble on a meal that had already been started for some german officers and they were surprised to find it so good and abundant   the germans may be starving but there's no sign of it here remarked frank as he threw himself down on the ground with a sigh of relief   trust the huns to look after their soldiers even if the civilians starve replied bart   
the people don't count in germany   only the military are taken seriously   they take the middle of the sidewalk and others are crowded to the wall   well i'm not quarreling with them just now on that account grinned billy   
i'm just glad there's plenty of grub here this morning   i'm not very partial to german cooking as a rule chuckled tom but this stew certainly smells good   how the boche officers would grit their teeth if they saw us wading into this   but his rejoicing was premature for just at this moment a cannon shot from the german lines tore its way through the kettle and the scalding broth was spattered all over the group that were lying about   
luckily it did no other damage but the chagrin of the boys was comical to see   i'd like to have hold of the gunner that fired that shot sputtered tom wrathfully as he wiped from his face some of the stew that had fallen to his share   you ought to have knocked wood when you talked of the german officers seeing us wading into their chow growled bart   there's a perfectly good stew gone to the dogs   
nothing personal in that i hope laughed frank because most of it came to us   i like mine inside put in billy as he gingerly removed a piece of meat from his ear   as an outside decoration i'm dead against stew   well cheer up fellows remarked frank   
the stew's past praying for but there's a lot of other things   and anyway we ought to be mighty thankful that the shot didn't remove some of us from the landscape as well as the kettle   what's the big noise about    asked a cheery voice and they looked up to see will stone regarding them with a quizzical grin   
chapter x.i.v. in close quarters the four camport boys greeted stone joyfully and gladly made room for him   it's another german atrocity grinned billy   they were sore at us for swiping their grub and they sent our kettle to smithereens   i'm glad they don't know about it anyway said tom i don't want any boche to have the laugh on me   
i guess they're not doing much laughing this morning remarked will stone as he dropped down on the ground beside them   or if they are it's on the wrong side of their mouths   we've certainly waxed them good and plenty said bart enthusiastically   jumbo was all to the good this morning exulted frank   
it did my heart good to see the way he ploughed along   there was nothing to it after he got started   he certainly scattered the huns good and plenty chortled billy   they ran like hares   
he does for em all right agreed stone glad to have his pride in his giant pet justified   and the best of it is that although the bullets came against his hide like hail on a tin roof he came through practically without a scratch   he sure is a tough old fellow   the tanks are wonders chimed in tom they've won this fight   
it was scrumptious the way they tore those entanglements up by the roots   without em we'd have lost ten times as many men as we did   so far we've gotten off pretty easily agreed stone but the hardest part of the fighting is coming   the boches have got their second wind by this time and there can't be any more surprises   
you fellows would better fill up now for you'll have to have plenty to stand up on   trust us laughed billy   we may be slow in some things but when it comes to filling up we're some pumpkins   but i certainly do feel sore about that stew   
billy'll never get over that laughed bart   he had his mouth all fixed for it   no other stew in all his life will ever taste so good to him as this one that he didn't get   it's always the biggest fish that gets away laughed stone as he fell to with the rest   
while they were eating there was a thunder of hoofs along the road   this had been such an unusual occurrence up to date that they sprang to their feet with eager interest   then the cavalry swept by   fine fellows the cavalrymen were on splendid mounts which they bestrode as though they had never done anything else in all their lives   
for months past they had chafed under restraint for since the struggle had settled down to trench warfare they had seldom seen service except on foot   but now their turn had come for with the broken line of the enemy had come a call for the cavalry to pursue and complete the demoralization of the foe   some class to that bunch remarked tom as he watched the flying column with an appraising eye   a little faster than your tanks old scout   
 remarked bart giving stone a nudge in the ribs   they sure are admitted stone   but don't forget that though we may be slow we get there just the same   after a brief resting spell the lines were reformed and the fighting was resumed   
the space between the second and the third lines was a wide one and the country was hilly with numerous lanes and ravines   these were being held in greater or less force by enemy troops posted in advantageous positions supported by machine guns while beyond them their big guns kept up a heavy fire to prevent the allied advance   to clean these up and get ready for an attack upon the third line was a work of hours as every foot of advance was bitterly contested by the germans who had now recovered from their surprise and fought desperately to stem the tide that had overwhelmed their first position   there were two or three villages in the fighting zone and one town of considerable size   
not that it was a town now in any real sense of the word   what had once been houses were now mere pitiful heaps of wood and stone and mortar and their inhabitants had long since been dispossessed or slain   it stood gaunt and desolate and forbidding in its mute protest against the pitiless storm of war to which it had fallen a victim   in cleaning out a particularly obnoxious nest of machine gun positions frank and his friends had been kept busy until nearly noon   
but at last the guns were silenced and the crews wiped out or captured   the boys started to regain their main force but the country was unfamiliar and they took a turning in the road which led toward the german lines instead of toward their own   gee    remarked tom as they trudged along maybe i'm not tired   
my feet feel as though they weighed a ton   perhaps they do gibed billy unfeelingly   considering the size of them i should say a ton was just about right   i notice your hoofs are not so small retorted tom but how much longer is this hike going to take   
 search me responded frank   to tell the truth i'm twisted up about the direction   seems to me we ought to strike some of our troops soon   it would be funny if we walked straight into the german lines observed billy   
funny    snorted tom yes as funny as a funeral   some people have a queer sense of humor   they were passing a hedge that walled off an orchard from the road when frank who was ahead saw before him a great wave of gray uniforms coming around a bend in the road   
quick fellows he whispered   over the hedge and down on the ground   like a flash the boys were out of sight and not one instant too soon for a moment later they could see through the hedge what seemed to be an endless line of gray uniforms going past at the double quick   they were evidently hurrying forward to reinforce their hard pressed comrades farther down the road   
the boys lay still as death until the troops had passed and then looked at each other ruefully   we're cut off ejaculated frank   those fellows are between us and our line   looks pretty bad said bart   
this is a pretty kettle of fish grumbled tom let's cut across the orchard and see if we can find some of our boys   they acted on the suggestion but found to their dismay that the germans were everywhere   in whatever direction they looked the only uniforms they saw were the detested field gray   the germans had rallied and the boys had been caught in the swirl of the returning tide   
we'll have to hide somewhere until our men drive back the huns and get as far as this orchard said billy   we're up against it for fair growled tom disconsolately   it's easy enough to talk of hiding but where shall we hide    asked bart   
if we stay here above ground we're bound to be spotted before long   let's make our way toward the town suggested frank   there wasn't a soul in sight there a few minutes ago   it seemed to be wholly deserted   
there must be plenty of hiding places in those heaps of stones or perhaps we can stow ourselves away in a cellar   let's get a hustle on too or we'll know sooner than we want to what a prison camp looks like   as quickly as they dared they crept along using every bit of cover that offered itself until they reached the outskirts of what had been the town   as frank had said it appeared to be wholly deserted at the moment   
it was clear that all available forces had been summoned away to stem the great drive   having satisfied themselves that there was no one about they moved cautiously from one street to another seeking some place of refuge   the prospect was not hopeful for there was scarcely a room in a single house that was not gaping wide open   doors were gone and windows had vanished   
there was hardly a place where anything as large as a cat could be free from detection   a mighty slim outlook grumbled tom as they crouched close to a pile of masonry near the corner of a street   stop grouching counseled frank   we may stumble across something at any minute   
stumble is right said bart as he rubbed a barked shin   i've been doing nothing else since we got in among these rock piles   that house over the way there seems in a little better condition than the rest of these heaps suggested billy pointing a little way down the street   we'll try our luck there said frank and again their cautious journey was resumed   
they reached the place and squeezed themselves in through a narrow opening on a side that had faced a tiny yard bordered by a wall about eight feet in height   there had been three rooms on the ground floor of the house but all three had been knocked into one by the visitation of shells   the boys picked their way over the uneven masses of plaster and frank gave an exclamation as he perceived an opening that seemed to lead down into a cellar   this way fellows he said as he looked down into the darkness   
i don't see any stairs here but we can take a chance and drop   it doesn't seem very deep   one of you hold this gun of mine and i'll go first   there was a chance of spraining an ankle if nothing worse but luckily he landed safely   
all serene he called up in a low tone   hand me down your guns and then come along   they did so and the four found themselves in a cluttered cellar that by feeling around with their hands they found to be about thirty feet long by twenty in width   there was a furnace which had been broken into a pile of junk and a little light filtering down showed where a pipe had formerly gone through to the upper floor   
there were a number of barrels in one corner but apart from these the cellar seemed to hold nothing but rubbish   it's as dark as egypt down here grumbled tom so much the better replied bart   there'll be that much less chance of a heinie seeing us if he takes the trouble to look down here   so this is where we've got to hang out until our boys get here remarked billy grinning   
it reminds me of the waldorf astoria it's so different   never mind said frank cheerfully it's a thousand per cent better than a hun prison camp and don't you forget it    you said a mouthful that time replied the irrepressible billy with more force than elegance   chapter x.v. the four footed enemy the first thing to do is to make a barricade of these barrels said frank when the four privates had made an inventory of what the cellar afforded in the way of defense   
they will help us in putting up a fight if the huns discover us here agreed bart   let's see if there's anything in them suggested billy   swell chance commented tom they smell as if they'd had wine or beer in them and you can trust the heinies to have drained them to the last drop   not that i want any of the stuff but if they were full they'd stop a bullet better than if they were empty   
they tested the barrels by knocking against them with the butts of their rifles and the hollow sound they gave back proved that tom had conjectured truly   dry as the desert of sahara pronounced frank   and that reminds me said bart   what are we going to do for water to drink   
 we've got grub enough in our kits to last us a couple of days in a pinch   but we can't hold out long without something to wash it down with   we won't worry about that yet said frank   i stepped into a puddle over in one corner while we were going round here   
i suppose that came from the rain we had last night   it doesn't fit my idea of what drinking water ought to be but it's a mighty sight better than dying of thirst   they got out their stock of food and decided that with careful rationing they had enough for two days   and that will be plenty prophesied billy   
our fellows will be here before long   perhaps this very night we'll be with the old bunch again   i wish i had your cheery disposition growled tom when any one hands you a lemon i make lemonade out of it came back billy and there was a general laugh   that's the way to talk said frank   
the huns haven't got us yet and even this hole is better than a german prison camp   you bet    responded billy   from all i hear those places are something fierce   
a fellow had better die fighting than die of abuse or starvation   that's what agreed bart   and that's another thing that shows how low the huns have stooped in this war   look at the way we treat them when we take them prisoners   
they live on the fat of the land   of course the germans haven't as much food in their country as we have and we don't expect so much for our men in the matter of grub although even at that they don't get enough to keep body and soul together   but it's sickening to hear of the way they torture them   one of their favorite sports is to set dogs on em   
if a man doesn't move quickly enough to suit em they stick a bayonet into him   it's low beastly tyranny that puts them on a level with the turks   it's no wonder that germany is coming to be hated and despised by the whole world   did you hear of the fire that happened in one of their camps   
 queried tom there was a hut in one corner of the camp with five men in it   it caught fire and the men who couldn't get out of the door because it was locked tried to get out of the window   the sentry thrust his bayonet into the first man and threw him back into the flames   the poor fellow made another attempt and again the sentry ran the bayonet into him   
and every one of the five men burned to death though every one of them could have been saved   what do you think of that fellows    isn't it the limit    they'll get theirs said frank bitterly   
they can't sow the wind without reaping the whirlwind   they'll surely pay soon or late for every bit of this brutality   i hope it will be soon said billy   i'm getting impatient   
it won't be long if we can keep up the pace we set this morning said bart   gee how our tanks went through those wires as though they were rotten cord   and our guns are keeping it up said frank   just listen to that roar   
what a shame it is we can't be out there doing our bit   it makes me feel like a slacker   it's the fortune of war said billy philosophically   but it's might hard luck just the same that we took the wrong direction after we cleared up that machine gun nest so neatly   
but let's have a hack at that grub fellows   oh boy if we only had some of that stew we lost this morning    that stew still sticks in billy's crop laughed frank   i only wish it did mourned billy   
but it never got that far   well just remember fellows that we're on rations now warned frank as he doled out a little portion to each from the common stock they had pooled together   we've got to make this last as long as we can   if we feel hungry when we get through we'll just have to tighten our belts and let it go at that   
they ate sparingly but although they were all thirsty especially after the heat and excitement of the fighting it was a long time before they could bring themselves to drink from the pool in the corner of the cellar   they finally had to come to it however though they tried to make it less repugnant by filtering it through the only clean handkerchief they could muster among them   the time dragged on interminably in their narrow quarters   they tried to sleep but though they were very tired after their strenuous day the novelty and discomfort of their position kept them on edge   
the daylight finally vanished from the little opening in the floor above and the darkness became absolute   they had matches in their kits but they feared to use them lest some prowling sentry might see the light through some rift in the masonry   the roar of the heavy artillery had died down though the guns still gave out an occasional challenge   the fighting for the day was evidently at an end   
but there had been no clash in the streets of the ruined town to betoken the arrival of the allied forces   however they might have fared in other parts of the battlefield the town itself had not been wrested from the germans   in all probability the boys were still in the midst of their enemies   another night as well as a day to stay in this shebang remarked tom when the hope of immediate rescue had failed them   
oh well to morrow's a new day said frank   a lot may happen between now and to morrow night   our grub will hold out till then anyway and if nothing better turns up we'll make a dash and try to reach our lines   he had scarcely stopped speaking when there was a loud clattering in the street as though a cavalry troop were passing through   
perhaps those are our men now    exclaimed billy jubilantly   perhaps assented frank   and they seem to be coming this way   
the pace of the horses died down as they neared the house and they finally stopped just before it   the boys could hear the troopers dismount and a moment later they heard footsteps on the floor above   they listened intently   would the first words they heard be english or german   
 if the first it would mean a boisterous shout to the men above and a hasty and joyful scramble out of their prison   if the second it would mean that they were in imminent danger of capture or death   a light filtered down through the hole where the stovepipe had been   somebody above had struck a match   
but he had evidently burned his fingers as he did so for the light went out and there was an impatient exclamation   donnerwetter just one word but it made the hearts of the listening boys go down into their boots   for it was a german who just then struck a second match and lighted a candle and it was a german cavalry troop whose horses stood before the door   but for what purpose had they entered the house   
 were they in search of the boys    had any one seen them entering the house and given information    be ready fellows whispered frank   it looks as if we were in for a scrap   
they clutched their rifles firmly to be ready for whatever might happen   but it was not long before they realized that this sudden irruption had nothing to do with them   what seemed to be a bench or a table was dragged across the floor and one or more candles placed upon it   there seemed to be half a dozen or more officers in the room and they were soon engaged in an earnest conversation   
i never thought much of the german language whispered bart to billy but i'd give a farm to understand it now   if frank only knew german as well as he does french responded billy we might pick up something that our officers would give a lot to know   for perhaps half an hour the raucous tones above continued   the debate was at times an angry one and was punctuated by the sound of fists brought heavily down on a table   
just after one of these the stovepipe hole was dimmed by something that shut off the light from the room above   it floated down with a slight rustle and the boys could see that it was a paper of some kind   in an instant frank had crept across and grabbed the paper thrusting it into the bosom of his shirt   then he moved swiftly back to the shelter of the barricade   
that was taking a chance old boy whispered bart as his friend resumed his place among them   if you'd knocked against anything and the huns had heard you they'd have been down here in a jiffy   i suppose it was a little risky returned frank but we've got to take risks sometimes and it struck me that there might be something in that paper that our officers would like to know   just then billy in trying to get in a less cramped position knocked against one of the rifles that had been stood in a corner   
it fell against one of the barrels with a clatter that in the confined place and the tense state of the boys' nerves sounded to them like thunder   frank grabbed it before it could fall on the cellar floor but it seemed as though the mischief must have been done and their hearts were in their mouths as they listened for anything that might indicate that the sound had been heard on the floor above   but the debate had reached a lively stage just at that moment and the incident attracted no attention so that after two minutes more of strained listening the boys were assured that they had come off scot free from what might have been a disaster   this is sure no place for a man with heart disease murmured tom and his comrades unanimously agreed with him   
the conference in the room above had come to an end as was shown by the shuffling of feet as the men rose from the table   there was a sound as of a sheaf of papers being hastily gathered together   but there was no outcry to indicate that any one of them was missing and the boys drew a long breath and relaxed their grasp on their rifles   there would be no search and for the moment they were safe   
the lights above were extinguished and the party went out   the horses clattered away and once more the house and the town were as still as the grave   so near and yet so far murmured frank when he was sure that the last of the unwelcome visitors had departed   that was what you might call too close for comfort grinned billy   
they wouldn't have done a thing to us if they had nabbed us declared bart   we wouldn't have had a chinaman's chance   no prison camp for ours    they'd have shot us down like dogs   
 they'd have reasoned that we had heard their military plans and that would have been all the excuse they wanted   not that they would care whether they had the excuse or not said billy   the mere fact that a german wants to do anything makes it all right to do it   how they'd froth at the mouth if they knew frank had that paper remarked tom i wonder what it is   
it has a seal on it and it feels as if it were heavy and official replied frank   i don't want to strike a match now but i'll take a squint at it when daylight comes   probably it's in german and if it is i can't read it   but they'll read it at headquarters all right and it may queer some of heinie's plans   
they conversed in whispers a little while longer and then made ready to go to sleep   their preparations were not extensive and consisted chiefly in finding a place where no sharp edge of stone bored into the small of their backs   but they were too tired to be critical and after putting away the food in a corner and arranging to stand watch turn and turn about they soon forgot their troubles in sleep   when they awoke the light shining through the hole in the floor told them that it was day   
time you fellows opened your eyes remarked tom who had been standing the last watch   if you hadn't i'd have booted you awake anyway for you were snoring loud enough to bring the whole german army down on you   i'd hate to call you an out and out prevaricator tom remarked billy rubbing his eyes and running his hands through his tumbled hair so i'll simply say that you use the truth with great economy   suppose you bring me my breakfast   
i think i'll eat it in bed this morning   he dodged the shoe that tom threw at his head and rose laughingly to his feet   mighty bad manners the people have at this hotel he remarked but since you feel that way about it i'll take my grub any way i can get it   haul it out from that corner bart and let's have a hack at it   
i'm hungry enough to eat nails this morning   bart needed no second request for he was quite as hungry as his mates   but when he picked up the canvas wrapper in which the food had been stored he dropped it with a startled exclamation   what's the matter   
 cried frank   matter enough replied bart   the bag's empty   there isn't a blessed thing in it   
the others rushed him under the light that came from above and examined the wrapper with sinking hearts   what bart had said was true   not a crumb was left   there was no mystery about it   
the gnawed and tattered holes in the bag told their own story   it was summed up in the one word that came from their lips simultaneously   rats    their four footed enemies had perhaps brought them nearer capture than their human enemies had been able to do   
chapter x.v.i. chased by cavalry the four army boys looked at each other in dismay   nothing much worse than this could have befallen them   it brought them close to the edge of tragedy   they would have to change their plans   
instead of being free to choose their own time for their attempt to escape they were forced to act quickly no matter how much greater the risk might be   for if they waited until they were weak from hunger they would be in no condition to make a dash or put up a fight   frank as usual was the first to recover his self possession no use crying over spilt milk fellows he said trying to infuse cheerfulness into his tone   we've got to try billy's recipe and make lemonade from the lemon that the rats have handed us   
it's a mighty big lemon said tom and i don't see much sugar lying around   how could the brutes have got at it without our hearing them do you suppose    questioned bart   that doesn't matter much replied billy   
and there's no use holding post mortems the thing is what are we going to do    we're going to get out of here to night without fail said frank decidedly   the moon won't come up till late and if the night is cloudy it won't show up at all   at any rate we can't stay here   
there isn't a chance on earth of there being anything left in these houses or we might take a chance on foraging   the huns have seen to that   the longer we stay here the weaker we'll get   we've just got to make a break and trust our wits and our luck to get back to the lines   
i guess you're right old man agreed bart   we'll just move our belts up a hole and pretend we're not hungry   tom here's getting too fat anyway and it'll do him good to give his stomach a rest   and as for billy he can take a nap and dream of that stew he didn't get   
there's another thing too remarked frank   those rats are likely to come back to night for more and they may have spread the news and bring a whole rat colony with them   no doubt they're famished since there's nothing left in the town to eat and if there are enough of them they might go for us   of course we could beat them off but we'd be apt to make a lot of noise in doing it and that might bring the huns down on us   
there's no use talking we've got to skip   they all agreed to this and they passed the rest of that day as best they could until the light faded from the hole in the floor and night settled down in a pall of velvet   they clambered out of their temporary prison their hearts beating with high determination   they ventured out at last into the darkness slipping along from one projection of the ruined houses to another moving as lightly and stealthily as cats   
to one thing they had made up their minds   there would be no going back to their old hiding place   that meant either starvation or surrender   besides if they turned back on being discovered the germans would know that they were hiding somewhere in the ruined town and they would not leave one stone on another until they found them   
but if they made a break for the open country they would have their chance of escaping in the darkness   on they went like so many spectres until on reaching a shattered doorway they crept close together for a whispered parley   so far so good murmured frank   luck's been with us agreed bert   
we can stand a whole lot of luck in this business whispered tom it's a long long way yet to our own lines said billy   we haven't got more than a couple of blocks away from our old hangout and there's no telling how much further it is before we strike the open country   just then a stone toppled from a wall and fell with a crash only a few feet away   in their tense state of alertness the unexpected sound made them jump   
just as well we weren't under that remarked frank with a sigh of relief   let's hope it won't bring some german sentry along to see what's making the racket responded bart   just what it is doing whispered tom as he heard a step approaching   quick fellows get further back and lie down flat   
they almost ceased to breathe as a dim form passed by so close that they could almost have reached out and touched him   but the dust still rising from the shattered stone convinced the visitor that nature and not man was responsible for the disturbance and with a grunt of satisfaction that it was nothing worse the sentry returned to his former post   but the promptness with which he had appeared warned the fugitives that the town desolate as it was was still under guard and they redoubled their precautions   however dangerous it might be they must go on   
the moon would rise before long and they must make the most of the pitchy darkness that still prevailed   listening with all their ears and straining their eyes until they ached they made their way through the littered streets until they realized from their frequent encounters with bush and hedge that they were getting into the open country   huddled close in a thicket they consulted the radio compass that frank drew from his pocket   that gave them the general direction in which they must go   
they knew that in general their course led toward the west but as they could not tell what changes had taken place in the position of the armies as the result of the two days' fighting they had no idea of how long it might take them to reach the american lines   they got their bearings due west and set off   they were making fair progress when they were startled by hearing the clatter of hoofs a little ahead of them   listen   
 hissed bart   it's a cavalry troop whispered frank as he flattened himself behind a bush an example that was promptly followed by the others   troop    growled tom it sounds more like a brigade   
uhlans probably conjectured billy   they peered through the bushes at the broad road not more than twenty feet away   at that moment the moon showed a slender rim above the horizon and threaded the darkness with a faint shimmer of light   along the road came a force of cavalry   
the guttural voices of the riders told the concealed watchers that they belonged to the enemy   in the dim light they could see the steam that rose from the horses' flanks   those days had been the first for a long time that cavalry could be used on the western front   trench fighting had put that arm of the service almost wholly out of action   
but the fact that the allies had followed up their tank attack with cavalry had brought forth a german response of the same nature   there was no sign of elation among the riders and the boys drew pleasure from that   a dejected air prevailed as though the uhlans had had the worst of it   guess they've had the hot end of the poker whispered bart   
looks like it replied frank   something just then frightened one of the horses and he reared and plunged into the bushes at the side of the road   the boys had all they could do to scramble out of reach of the iron shod hoofs   the rider was almost unhorsed but managed to retain his seat and quiet his trembling mount   
by the time he had done this the troopers had almost passed   the boys were rejoicing at this but their exultation changed to uneasiness when the soldier who had had so much trouble rode up to an officer and began to talk volubly at the same time pointing toward the bushes   here's where i see trouble coming muttered tom he's on to us agreed bart   he must have seen us when we got out of his way said frank   
let's get out of here quick   but this was not to be done so easily for even as he spoke the officer rapped out a command and a group of twenty horsemen began to spread out and surround the place where the army boys were crouching   to remain there would be fatal for it was only a matter of a few minutes before that ring would close upon them with a grip of iron   at all hazards they must break through   
stick together fellows murmured frank   get your rifles ready   we can't miss at this distance   when i say the word give them a volley and make a break for the road   
it's our only chance for they'd surely round us up in these bushes   we're with you boy replied bart and the little party crouched lower with their fingers on trigger   frank waited until the nearest horsemen were not more than ten feet away   then he sprang to his feet with a shout   
fire    he cried and a stream of flame leaped from the bushes   two of the riders threw up their hands and pitched from their saddles   a third seized with his left hand the rein that dropped from his right   
there was a moment of confusion and frank and his comrades took instant advantage of it   with a rush they reached the road and tore down it for dear life while behind them thundered the uhlans in hot pursuit    chapter x.v.i.i. the broken bridge the army boys had no idea where the road led to   it might be to the american lines or to the german lines   
but they knew that certain death was behind them and possible life in front of them and they ran as though their feet had wings   but swift as they were the horses were of course swifter and before long they knew that their pursuers were gaining   throw away your rifles panted frank   we'll still have our knives and grenades   
they threw the heavy rifles aside and relieved of their weight they bounded ahead with renewed speed   for a short time their desperate efforts held their pursuers even but soon the gap again began to close   at a turn of the road they halted gasping for breath   give them the grenades ordered frank getting his own ready   
they won't be expecting them and it may upset them   throw yours at the same time i do mine   they waited until the horsemen were within fifty feet   then four stalwart arms hurled the grenades against the front ranks   
there was a tremendous explosion as the shells all seemed to go off at the same instant and the first rank of horsemen went down in a heap   those behind drew their beasts back on their haunches so as not to override their fellows and in that moment another volley came among them with deadly effect   without waiting any longer the boys renewed their flight   they knew that the germans would be mad with rage at their check by so small a force and they were not foolish enough to believe for a moment that the chase would be abandoned   
but a new exultation was in their hearts as they ran   they might be killed but they would at least have sold their lives dearly   there would be little that the uhlans would have to boast of in their story of that night's work   their breath came in short gasps and their laboring lungs felt as though they were ready to burst   
frank a little in the van reached out a warning hand and they slowed up   we'll make faster time if we give ourselves a minute's rest he panted   when we start in again we'll have our second wind   they haven't got out of that mix up yet   
besides they'll come on more cautiously now   they won't know how many grenades we have left   i haven't any gasped tom billy was too far gone to speak but he drew his last grenade from his sack   bart and frank also were down to their last one for the work on the previous day had almost used up the stock with which they had started out   
they had a chance for one last throw and then if it came to a hand to hand fight they had nothing to rely on but their knives   they rested for a minute or two and then again upon the wind came the sound of hurrying hoofs   instinctively the boys reached out and grasped one another's hands   there was no need for words   
they knew what it meant   to some of them this might prove the last lap of the last race they would ever run   on came their pursuers and the boys summoning up every ounce of strength they possessed set out at the pace of hunted deer   not two minutes had elapsed before their feet struck the boards of a bridge   
below they saw the gleam of the moon in the dark water that ran beneath   they took heart at the sight and put on a new burst of speed   who knew but what the american troops were camped on the further side    twenty feet further they stopped abruptly   
the bridge was broken   the boards had been torn up though the shattered timbers of the sides projected a few feet further over the current   but fully a hundred feet of black water stretched between them and the farther shore   they stopped panting and perplexed   
and just at that moment they heard the hoofs of horses on the wood of the bridge   they were trapped   to turn back was certain captivity or death   to plunge into that black current might also mean death   
their choice was made on the instant   over we go boys    shouted frank throwing off his coat   but we mustn't waste those last grenades   
let them have them   they turned and threw and without waiting to see the result dived headforemost into the stream   the roar of the explosion was in their ears as they struck the water   they were all good swimmers and when they came to the surface they found themselves within a few feet of each other   
to the other bank fellows    exclaimed frank as he shook the water from his eyes   and keep as low in the water as you can   they'll send a volley after us   
they struck out lustily for the farther shore while as frank had predicted bullets zipped around them   but in the darkness their foes could take no aim and they reached the shore unscathed   the bank was steep with long reeds growing down to the water's edge   the fugitives grasped these and rested before they attempted to climb the bank   
i'm all in gasped tom frank reached out a supporting hand   i guess we all are he replied   it's lucky this river isn't wider   but we're safe now   
i don't know about that said bart   listen    there was a tramp of many feet upon the bank   they've heard the shooting whispered billy   
if it's our boys we're all right   if it isn't the sentence was never finished   above the bank they saw a crowd of helmeted figures   a light was flashed into their faces nearly blinding them and a hoarse voice cried wer da   
 a score of hands reached down and grasped them   unarmed dripping utterly exhausted they found themselves in the hands of the soldiers of the kaiser    chapter x.v.i.i.i. rescue from the s.k.y. with a file of soldiers on either side of them the four boys were marched off to a dugout near at hand   here a german outpost had been stationed to watch the river bank   
it was not a large command and the lieutenant in charge being unable to speak english and having no interpreter at hand after a few brusque attempts to question them gave it up   then after having had them searched he committed them to the custody of a non commissioned officer with directions that they were to be fed and sent to headquarters in the morning   they ate ravenously and not being permitted to talk to each other found solace in sorely needed sleep   when taken before the german officers the friends were forced to undergo a strict and searching examination   
their questioners tried in every way with pleadings alternating with threats to get them to divulge information that might be useful to them but in vain   the four americans were absolutely uncommunicative and at last the german who had been doing most of the questioning was forced to acknowledge defeat   donnerwetter    he growled   
yankee pigs    it must be that they are so stupid that they do not know anything to tell   what do you think herr lieutenant    turning to one of his officers   
i think it more likely that they are just obstinate sir like those cursed english replied the officer addressed   but perhaps a few months in a prison camp will incline them to answer more quickly when a german speaks to them   this was accompanied by a cruel smile whose significance was hot lost on the americans   the captain glared at them but as they did not seem to weaken perceptibly even under his high displeasure he grumbled finally well take them away and we'll see how they act after a taste of prison life   
as their guards were about to take them from the room he continued menacingly remember you yankees that the sooner you tell me what i want to know the easier it will be for you   and in the end we'll make you talk   it is not well to oppose germany's will too far   but as the prisoners did not appear greatly frightened by these threats the commander at last ordered the sergeant in charge to take the prisoners away and turned again to his desk   
in spite of the critical situation in which they found themselves bart could not resist a surreptitious wink at his companions as they passed through the doorway which was returned in kind by his graceless companions   but although they had had the satisfaction of balking the german officers they were not long in appreciating the discomforts of their present situation   when they reached the temporary prison camp they were herded into a large tent already overcrowded with french english and a few american prisoners   soon after their arrival food was served out although it hardly seemed worthy of the name   
watery soup made by boiling turnips in water and a small chunk of some tasteless substance supposed to be bread constituted the meal   the boys fresh from the wholesome and abundant food furnished by uncle sam found it absolutely uneatable and gave away their portions to some of the other prisoners who appeared glad to get it   wait until you've been here a few days said one lanky englishman with a ghastly smile you'll get so thoroughly famished that you'll be able to go even that stuff and he made a wry face   perhaps so if we can't find some way to get out said frank   
not as easy as it sounds said the englishman   although it has been done of course   but a lot more have been shot trying it than have ever got away   might as well get shot as die of starvation remarked tom this opinion evidently appealed to tom's comrades who looked significantly at him   
from that look each knew that the others were ready to risk everything to gain their freedom   the englishman however seemed unconvinced and presently left them   as night came on they cast about for some place to sleep but met with little success   the only place to lie was on the ground but by that time the four friends were so tired that sleep even under any hardship was desirable   
they finally settled down in a corner that appeared a little less crowded than the rest   however before going to sleep they tried to formulate some plan of escape but with indifferent success   about all we can do said bart finally is to hold ourselves in readiness to make use of the first chance of escape that comes along   and if these germans are all as stupid as the ones we've seen so far it oughtn't to be very difficult   
well when the chance comes we won't let any grass grow under our feet that's certain said frank   but now i'm dog tired and i'm going to see if i can't get a little sleep   and what's more i'd advise you fellows to do the same   he who sleeps dines quoted tom with a somewhat rueful grin   
i hope there's more in that old saying than there is in most of them   right you are said bart but something seems to tell me i'm going to be hungry in the morning just the same   bart was right   after a restless night the boys woke with ravenous appetites and managed to eat most of the unpalatable fare that was passed around   
not long after this they saw the sergeant who had had charge of them the previous day picking his way through the crowd evidently looking for some particular object   at last he caught sight of the americans and immediately headed toward them   come he commanded roughly in his halting english   orders have come for your removal   
where to    inquired frank   silence    do as you are told and ask no questions   
 commanded the german   for two cents i'd jump on him and choke the dog's life out of him    muttered tom but his friends laid restraining hands on him   nothing doing tom warned billy   
we'd be playing against stacked cards in a game like that   take it easy now and maybe our chance will come later   meanwhile the sergeant had started off and the friends had no choice but to follow him   he led them out of the tent where a squad of soldiers was lined up   
at a nod from the sergeant these surrounded the boys and at a curt word of command they all started off   they were soon outside the confines of the camp and marching along what had once been a perfect road but was now badly broken up by the combined effects of shellfire and heavy trucking   the soldiers talked among themselves in low gutturals and the boys by piecing together words that they caught here and there gathered that they were being taken to some higher official for further questioning   you see said billy they know we were inside their lines a considerable time before they caught us and so they are paying particular attention to us   
i guess they think we may know more than we've told them so far   this with a wink at his friends   we sure have told them a lot put in bart grinning   and just to be perfectly fair i suggest that we tell the next boche who questions us just as much as we told the last one   
fair enough agreed tom no favoritism has always been my motto   no talking among the prisoners commanded the sergeant threateningly and the four friends having said about all they wanted to say anyway relapsed into silence   for several miles the little group plodded along often meeting detachments of german infantry who scowled sullenly at the americans as they passed   the boys were far from happy in spite of the light hearted attitude they presented to their captors   
they all knew that if they could not effect an escape their chance for life was small as on account of their having been inside the german lines so long before being captured the huns would seize the opportunity of calling them spies and mete out the quick end that is accorded to such   they were walking along each one immersed in his own gloomy thoughts when suddenly a sound from above caused them to look quickly up toward the blue sky   what they saw caused their hearts to beat faster and hope to spring up again in their breasts   for skilled as they were in such matters they recognized the airplane up above whose roaring exhaust had first attracted their attention as one of the allied type   
it was coming toward them at high speed flying low and as it rapidly neared them the four friends forgetting their german captors waved their hands wildly to the pilot whom they could see as the aeroplane came closer peering down over the side of the body   the germans on their part were so terrified by the approach of this huge enemy machine that they seemed to forget all about their prisoners and in fact about everything except their individual safety   with wild yells of terror they scattered this way and that all except the sergeant   he seeing his men running in every direction snarled out a curse and whipped out his automatic pistol   
i'll do for you yankees anyway he hissed and leveled the pistol at them   but even as his finger trembled on the trigger frank's fist with the force of a sledgehammer came with a crashing impact against the point of the german's jaw and the hun went down his pistol exploding harmlessly toward the sky   frank with the light of battle in his eye seized the fallen man's weapon and looked around for the other germans   but by this time they had all gotten out of effective pistol range and after emptying the weapon in the direction of the fleeing figures frank and the others turned their attention to the aeroplane which by now was manoeuvring for a landing   
the airship came down in great spirals and finally took the ground with hardly a jar running along a hundred feet or so and then coming to a halt   as the boys started running toward it tom ejaculated say fellows my eyes may be playing me tricks but if that isn't dick lever at the wheel you can call me a german    i think it is dick myself agreed frank   and if this isn't a case of the friend in need i miss my guess   
it was indeed as they thought   the pilot was an old friend of theirs but one whom they had not seen for some time   now as they raced toward the airplane he in turn recognized them and raised a delirious shout of joy   tumble into this bus just as fast as you can fellows he cried we've got to get out of this mighty quick   
you can explain the mystery of your being here after we get started   but can you carry the whole bunch of us    asked billy   easily replied one of the two observers who had not spoken up to now   
we've just dropped our load of bombs on a few german supply depots and now we're running back light   all right then said billy in we go    and suiting the action to the word the four friends swarmed into the airplane filling the cramped passenger carrying space to overflowing   meantime the germans having found cover had opened up a brisk rifle fire against the aeroplane and bullets began to sing through the framework   
one of the observers leaped to the ground gave the propeller a vigorous twist and as the motor began to roar clambered aboard as the big plane started over the rough ground bumping and jolting but rapidly gaining speed   the germans broke from their shelter in pursuit firing wildly as they ran but although some of their shots came close none came near enough to do any real damage   in a few seconds in answer to a quick movement from dick lever the big bombing machine left the ground and amid a parting rain of bullets from the germans started to ascend in long sweeping spirals   the friends were about to congratulate themselves on their safe escape when suddenly one of the observers who had been scanning the horizon closely pointed behind them and exclaimed just as i thought   
 those two boche planes that we saw getting ready to come after us just after we dropped our last bomb are coming up fast   look    all twisted about and saw that it was as the observer had said   high up in the sky two swift darting objects were coming in pursuit   
the american machine was built more for carrying capacity than for speed and in addition was heavily loaded   every advantage was with the swift german machines   their pilots no doubt realized this for now they headed directly for the americans descending in a long slant that gave them tremendous speed   all right said lever coolly if they're going to come down it may be a good idea for us to go up and suiting the action to the word he elevated the nose of the big plane skyward and they started to climb steeply   
the american machine was equipped with a tremendously powerful motor and this combined with its great wing spread enabled it to climb with great rapidity in spite of the heavy load it was carrying   the germans had not counted on this and the result was that they miscalculated their distances passing beneath the american flyer instead of above it as they had intended   they both turned quickly and started to climb but by this time the american aviators had trained their two machine guns on the germans and opened fire   at first this seemed to have little effect and the germans ascended rapidly while their machine gun operators although as yet unable to use their deadly weapons sent a hail of revolver bullets whistling through the wings and rigging of the american machine   
but now the concentrated fire from the american machine was beginning to have effect   one of the german planes hesitated quivered and suddenly its right wing with its wire stays severed by the machine gun bullets crumpled up   the crippled aeroplane staggered wildly suddenly turned on its right side and pitched steeply downward   the boys in the american airplane gazed at each other with white faces but they had little time to devote to thoughts of the fallen for by now the remaining german machine was on a level with them and its machine gunner opened fire   
the americans crouching low to avoid the murderous stream of bullets returned the fire from both their machine guns with a deadliness of purpose and aim for which the german was no match   suddenly a tiny flame appeared in the body of the german machine grew with lightning rapidity and in a few seconds one side of the machine was enveloped in leaping yellow flames   punctured the gas tank    exulted lever   
they're done for now   and he was right   the machine gun fire from both fighting planes died out and the boys could see the germans vainly trying to beat out the hungry flames   their efforts were useless however and in a few seconds the german machine a roaring mass of flame and black smoke dropped downward as swiftly as a stone   
as it went the boys saw two figures hurl themselves out into space and then everything was hidden in a haze of billowy smoke   that's awful    exclaimed tom drawing in his breath with a great sigh while all relaxed from the terrible tension they had been under   awful yes said dick lever   
but it's only what they would have done to us if they had been able   instead of live and let live it's kill or get killed in this game   frank nodded his head gloomily but none of the boys felt like talking then and sat silent as their pilot got his bearings and then straightened out swiftly in the direction of the american lines   with the roar of the motor in their ears and the rush of wind past their faces much of the horror of the deadly air battle was swept from their minds and they began to enjoy the exhilaration of their first flight   
the distant earth streamed rapidly by like a swiftly flowing river and a wonderful panorama was spread out below them   it was an exceptionally clear day and they could see for many miles in every direction   below them groups of gray clad figures after a glance in the direction of the soaring monster overhead broke for cover or shaking impotent fists trudged stolidly onward contemptuous of one more danger among the many that daily surrounded them   no prison camp for us this time exulted frank as he looked down at his enemies   
we wouldn't have been in a prison camp long declared tom those fellows had picked us out for a firing squad   they were going to get all they could out of us and then about six feet of earth would have been our size   i'll bet that sergeant's jaw aches yet from the clip that frank handed him chuckled billy happily   i skinned my knuckles said frank looking at them ruefully   
never mind laughed bart   you never hurt them in a better cause   we can't be far from the lines now shouted frank in dick's ear   pretty close responded the aviator   
we ought to be down fifteen minutes from now   and his estimate proved very nearly correct   soon the boys of the old thirty seventh could recognize the familiar landmarks of their own encampment and with one impulse they gave three rousing cheers   chapter x.i.x. putting one over it was a beautiful landing that dick lever made at the aviation camp his great machine sailing down like a swan and landing so lightly that it would scarcely have broken a pane of glass   
dick you're a wonder    exclaimed frank as he stepped out of the machine   the way you put it all over the boche planes shows that chimed in bart with equal enthusiasm   i don't wonder they say you're an ace added billy   
if all aviators had your class the hun flyers wouldn't have a chance on earth i mean in the sky said tom oh it's all a matter of practice said dick modestly although it was plain to be seen that their heartfelt appreciation pleased him   it's as easy as running an automobile when you know how   well so long fellows   i've got to make my report and with a gay wave of the hand he left them and made his way to aviation headquarters   
say how does it feel to be a free man once more    cried frank jubilantly as they sought out their regiment   i can't believe yet that it's anything but a dream   replied bart with deep feeling as he looked around at the friendly faces and familiar surroundings that he had feared for a time he would never see again   
and look at that flag    cried billy as he saw old glory flying from one of the officers' pavilions   like a flash their hats came off and they saluted the glorious flag that meant to them everything in life   they passed the tanks and will stone who was grooming his pet looked at them for a moment as though he could not believe his eyes   
then he rushed toward them and nearly shook their hands off   by all that is lucky    he cried   i was afraid i was never going to see you fellows again   
where did you drop from    from the sky laughed frank   some little angels you see chuckled billy   then seeing stone's puzzled look he added the huns had got their hooks on us when dick lever came along in his plane gave them a few little leaden missives picked us up and landed us here right side up with care   
stone's eyes kindled as he heard their story and his enthusiasm over lever's feat was as great as their own   but how did we make out in the big drive    asked frank   we kept hoping all the time that you fellows would be along and nab us before the boches did   
we've had a big victory explained stone   we put the hindenburg line on the blink by that smash at his center and he's had to draw in his wings on both sides   it's one of the biggest things that's been done on the western front and the heinies will have a hard time explaining it in berlin   that's bully   
 exclaimed frank   that town you fellows were hiding in didn't come into our general plan went on stone and that's the reason you had to fight your way out all by your lonesome   it was some little fight all right remarked tom and we certainly gave those uhlans a run for their money laughed billy   lucky they didn't get hold of you said stone   
it would have been curtains for the whole bunch   they must have been wild at the lacing you handed them   i guess they were rather peeved grinned bart   i'm sorry i had to throw away my rifle though mourned tom tom would find something to grouch about if he were in heaven laughed frank   
they talked for a few minutes longer and then went on as they were eager to be once more with their comrades of the old thirty seventh and what a greeting they had when they walked into their old command    they were pounded and mauled in wild enthusiasm for they were prime favorites in the regiment and had been sadly given up as dead or captured   they had to tell again and again the story of their adventures and it was only by main force that they tore themselves away from their rejoicing mates long enough to report themselves to their officers as present for duty   their captain was as delighted as his men at their safe return although his satisfaction was expressed in less boisterous fashion   
he commended warmly the gallant fight they had put up with the uhlans and he was visibly startled as his eye glanced over the german report that had been captured by frank when it fluttered down into the cellar   this must go to headquarters at once    he exclaimed   it is a matter of the utmost importance   
you men have deserved the thanks of the army he continued and i am proud that you are members of my command   they made their way back to their company with their leader's praise ringing in their ears and warming their hearts   but they had scarcely got out of the captain's presence before his chums pounced upon frank with the liveliest curiosity   how did you keep that paper when the germans searched you   
 asked tom where did you hide it    demanded billy   i never knew you were a sleight of hand performer added bart   easy there fellows laughed frank enjoying their mystification   
it was the simplest thing in the world   while you fellows were sleeping in the cellar i just loosened the sole of my shoe and slipped the paper in between the sole and the upper and nailed the sole up again   the heinies didn't get next to it and that's where i had luck   i'm mighty glad they didn't for the cap seems to think there's something in it that's worth while   
foxy stunt approved tom some wise boy    exclaimed billy giving his chum a slap on the shoulder that made him wince   you're all there when it comes to the gray matter old man was bart's tribute   a day later part of their reward came in a week's furlough that was granted them for specially gallant conduct as the order of the day expressed it   
the rest was welcome for it was the first they had had since they had landed on french soil and they had been under a strain of hard work and harder fighting that had taxed even their strong vitality to the utmost   and that week stood out forever in their memory like an oasis in a desert   they spent it in a little french town miles away from the firing line and even beyond the sound of the guns   they fished and swam and loafed and slept as though there was no such thing as war in the world   
no reveille to wake them in the morning no taps to send them to their beds at night   for the first time in months they were their own masters and they enjoyed their brief liberty to the full   yet even here in this little bit of heaven as tom expressed it they could not be wholly free from war's reminder   they were sprawling one day outside their cottage when an officer came along gorgeous in epaulets and gold lace   
see who's coming    exclaimed tom peevishly   now we'll have to get up and salute   i suppose so said billy reluctantly   
can't we pretend we don't see him    yawned bart sleepily clutching at a straw of hope   not a chance in the world declared frank   he's looking right at us   
they stood up as the officer approached and saluted respectfully   he returned the salute snappishly and glared at them sternly   get in line there he commanded   smart now   
eyes ahead   they resented his tone but obeyed with military promptness   present arms   they hesitated and looked at each other   
present arms i said   if you please sir said bart we have no guns   i know it snapped the officer   go through the motions   
so without a word they did as directed   shoulder arms   they did so   forward   
 march    he set off in front with a military stride and they followed   i feel like a fool whispered bart to frank   same here was the reply   
what does he mean by it    wants to show his authority i reckon muttered bart   tom and billy said nothing but there were scowls on their faces that spoke for them   they had marched for perhaps half a mile when at a cross roads two men appeared who were evidently looking for some one   
their eyes lighted up when they saw the officer and they came straight toward him   he saw them coming and throwing his dignity to the wind started to run but they were quicker than he and grasped him by the collar   come back to the asylum one of them growled   we've had lots of trouble to find you   
the boys stood rooted to the spot   you see explained one of the men touching his forehead significantly he's a grocer that's got the military bug   he thinks he's napoleon   come along napoleon   
and napoleon meekly obeyed   chapter x.x. suspicion to paint the emotions that chased themselves over the features of the four boys would have taxed the ability of an artist   for a moment no one of them cared to look into the eyes of the others   tom was the first to act   
he grabbed his cap in his hands kneaded it into a ball threw it on the ground and jumped up and down on it   the others looked at his scowling face and the sight was too much for them   they threw themselves on the ground in convulsions of laughter   they howled   
they roared   they rolled over and over until tom himself caught the contagion and joined in with the rest   it was a long time before any one of them was able to speak   stung   
 choked bart while tears of merriment rolled down his cheeks   forward    march    gurgled billy   
pound me on the back you fellows or i'll have a fit   a grocer    napoleon    roared frank   
shades of austerlitz and waterloo    and we fell for it    yelled tom think of it fellows    by the great horn spoon   
 we fell for it    they got themselves under control at last though not without many interruptions for again and again one of them would start to speak and go off into a peal of laughter   i'm as weak as a rag gulped billy   i haven't laughed like this in all my life   
it would make a hit in vaudeville chuckled bart   think of us sillies stalking along and going through shadow motions for a nut like that   we're squirrel food all right   well after all what could we do   
 defended frank   we're not mind readers   not even of a scrambled mind like that interposed billy   and we couldn't tell that he wasn't an officer went on frank not heeding the interruption   
his uniform seemed to be all right although a bit gaudy   that gives us a way out said bart   we can say that we followed the uniform not the man and let it go at that   but oh boy   
 if the fellows of our regiment had seen us trotting along behind that lunatic maybe they wouldn't make our life a burden   we'd never have heard the last of it agreed tom but what they don't know won't hurt them and it's a safe bet that none of us will ever let out a squeak   it's lucky there wasn't any moving picture man handy laughed frank   he'd have had a film that would put all the rest out of business   
but now let's get back to the cottage after this unfortunate hike of ours   say put in bart as a new thought struck him do you think those keepers could have caught on    i don't think they tumbled billy reassured them   they were too intent on catching napoleon to think of anything else   
poor napoleon chuckled frank   i suppose he's back on saint helena by this time   well there's one comfort anyway declared tom he doesn't know that he put anything over on us   if he hasn't forgotten us altogether he thinks we're part of the old guard   
they say a philosopher is one who can grin when the laugh is on himself laughed billy   if that's so we're dandy philosophers   all too soon that pleasant week was over and the boys refreshed and rested went away though with many a backward glance to the stern work where they had already won their spurs and made their mark   they started in on their work again with renewed zest and with quickened energy for a battle was impending and they were anxious to take their part in driving back the hun they saw rabig frequently and though they all disliked him heartily he was still a soldier like themselves in the service of uncle sam and they strove to disguise their feeling for the good of the common cause   
he's a bad egg all right declared tom who stuck obstinately to his belief that rabig had had some part in the escape of the german corporal but as long as we can't prove it we'll have to give him a little more rope   but sooner or later he'll come to the end of that rope and don't you forget it    nick had come out of the court martial that investigated the escape not with flying colors but with bedraggled feathers   the cut on his head had proved so slight as to arouse suspicion that it might have been self inflicted still the motive for this did not seem adequate and the upshot of the inquiry was that rabig was confined a few days in the guardhouse and then restored to duty   
but in the private books of the officers there was a black mark against him and all of them would have been better pleased not to have had him in the regiment   oh well don't let's talk about him frank summed up a discussion about the bully   the whole subject leaves a bad taste in my mouth   i only hope he's the only rotten apple in the barrel   
that's just the trouble replied tom if that rotten apple isn't taken out of the barrel a good many more may be spoiled in less than no time   sure enough agreed bart   but i guess there isn't much danger in this case   if nick had lots of friends that he might influence it might be different but you notice that the fellows leave him to flock by himself   
he's about as popular as the hives in summertime for a fact commented tom he'd be a mighty sight more at home if he were in the trenches on the other side   maybe so admitted frank   what are you fellows chinning about    broke in a familiar voice and they turned to see dick lever regarding them with a friendly grin   
hello dick came from them all at once in a roar of welcome for it was the first time they had seen him since he had rescued them from their german captors and their feelings toward him were of the warmest nature   where have you been keeping yourself    asked frank   we've been looking for you to drop in and see us for a long time past   
as a matter of fact i did get down this way about a week ago replied dick as he tried to shake hands with all four at once but the whole bunch of you were off on furlough   sorry we missed you said frank   yes we did get a few days off and it didn't do us a bit of harm   we've all come back feeling the best ever   
ready to take another crack at the huns eh    grinned dick   some fellows never know when they have enough   you needn't talk laughed bart   
i'll bet you've been popping away at them every day since we saw you last   oh they've kept me pretty busy said dick carelessly   the hun flyers are getting pretty sassy just now and we have to keep working hard to drive them back   i've noticed more of them flying over our lines than usual in the last day or two remarked billy   
say broke in tom this is sure our lucky day   here comes will stone   we sure are lucky when two of the best fellows in the world drop in on us at the same time said frank as he and his mates greeted the bronzed tank operator   i don't know whether you two fellows know each other but if you don't you've both lost something   
oh we're not altogether strangers smiled stone as he and dick shook hands heartily   many a time i've seen his plane flying overhead and it's made me feel rather comfortable to know that he was on the job and that no boche flyer would have a chance to drop something that would put jumbo out of commission   it would have to be some bomb that would make junk of that big car of yours said dick   i was flying pretty low the day we smashed the boche lines and i saw the way jumbo snapped those wires as though they were so many threads   
that tank's a wonder and no mistake   they were having such a good time and the time flew so rapidly that they were startled when the bugle blew and they were compelled to go to their respective quarters   a few nights after his return frank was assigned to sentry duty on an important post on the front trenches   his beat terminated at a point where he could see a little shack that stood on the side of a hill   
standing as it did in the battle zone it had become little more than a ruin   most of the thatched roof had been shot away one side had gone altogether and the other three sides leaned crazily toward each other   it was a little after midnight when frank thought he saw a gleam of light either in the cabin or close by it   it was very faint scarcely more than the glimmer of a firefly and it vanished instantly   
still it had been there   cautiously avoiding every twig with the stealth of an indian frank crept toward the hut   chapter x.x.i. a familiar voice as frank neared the cabin he redoubled his precautions and it was here that his scout training stood him in good stead   when he was within twenty feet he went down flat on the earth and wormed his way to one of the sides that had been left standing   
he placed his ear against a board and listened intently   but not a sound rewarded him   the deepest silence reigned   for a moment he was tempted to believe that his eyes had played a trick on him   
but they had seldom done this and he had learned to trust them   the light could not have come from a firefly for it was too late in the season for them   what then had caused it    he worked his way around to the shattered doorway and inch by inch lifted his head until his eyes were on a level with the floor   
quickly they swept the room which was so small that the faint light that came from the stars enabled him to see that it was empty   when he was fully assured of this he crept into the room and with his fingers explored every inch of the floor   the apartment was so small that this was not much of a task and before long his hand came in contact with a match   it had been lighted and the softness of the charred end told him that this had been done recently   
this then was the firefly    he continued his search with renewed caution and soon found a cartridge   he knew from the feel of it that it was of the kind used in the rifles with which the american troops were equipped   it was still warm as though it had been recently in a belt close to a man's body   
but what was a man doing in that lonely spot at that hour of the night    was he a prowling spy from the german camp who had made a daring incursion into the american lines    he must solve the mystery   with every faculty at its highest pitch he moved out into the open   
a slight rustling in the forest near by fell on his ears   it might have been made by some woodland creature but to his strained senses every sound however slight suggested a possible clue   he listened intently and heard it again but this time it was a trifle louder than before   he rose to his feet and with catlike tread moved in the direction of the sound   
as he drew hearer he heard it more plainly   and now his patience was rewarded for he distinctly heard the low tone of a human voice   and if it was a human voice it must of necessity be an enemy voice for no friend of his or of uncle sam's could be in that place at that hour on a legitimate errand   a moment later he detected another voice in a different key yet pitched hardly above a whisper   
so it was a conference    a conference of whom and about what    he crept still farther forward   right before him stretched a little glade full of small trees and undergrowth with a scarcely visible path leading downward   
to press too far between the bushes would have inevitably betrayed him   he halted with his rifle ready for action and listened   the conversation seemed to be an earnest one and in their earnestness the conferees at times forgot caution for as one of the men raised his voice in expostulation frank could note that he was talking german   but it was not that which made him start suddenly and clutch his rifle more tightly   
he had heard that voice before   where and when    he cudgeled his brain and then it came to him   it was nick rabig's voice   
 that is he thought it was   but at that distance he could not be perfectly sure   at any rate it was time to act   with a bound he leaped forward   
halt    he cried   halt or i fire   there were startled exclamations from both men and then a prodigious scrambling in the bushes as they tried to escape   
bang    went frank's rifle and there was a scream followed by a heavy fall   frank rushed forward but caught his foot in a tangled root and fell   his gun flew from his hand and his head came in contact with a stump   
the jagged edges cut a gash in his forehead and for a moment he was utterly dazed   he strove desperately to retain his senses and in a minute or two his brain ceased to whirl   he staggered drunkenly to his rifle and picked it up   and at this moment there was a sound of hurrying feet and wilson the corporal of the guard came running up accompanied by fred anderson who had been on duty near by   
what is it sheldon    asked the corporal what were you shooting at    frank tried to speak but his tongue was thick and the words would not come   he's wounded   
 exclaimed anderson as he saw with alarm the blood flowing freely from frank's forehead   they deftly bound up his head and by this time frank had found his voice   it's nothing he managed to say   i fell and cut my head   
it's only a scratch   i heard two men talking german here in the bushes and i started in to get them   they wouldn't stop when i ordered them to and i fired i don't know whether i got them or not   we'll see said the corporal and led the way into the bushes while frank and fred followed close on his heels   
from one side to the other the corporal flashed his light and before long he uttered an exclamation   you got one of them anyway he said as the light fell on the dead body of a german whose uniform showed that he belonged to the eighth bavarian regiment which they knew was stationed opposite them at that part of the line   the corporal blew his whistle and other men of his squad came running in answer to the call   he ordered them to carry the body into camp where it could be searched for papers   
then he turned to frank   you've done well sheldon he said and i'm sorry that you were hurt   you're relieved from duty for the rest of your watch   i'll put another man in your place   
you'd better see the surgeons and have them wash out that cut of yours and bind it up again   then tumble in and go to sleep   i hope you'll be all right in the morning   frank did as he was directed and after the surgeon had dressed his wound and pronounced it not serious made his way to his bunk   
he had to pass rabig's bunk in reaching his own and he stopped there for a moment   the place was dark but he could see that the bunk was occupied and from the snoring that arose from it the inmate seemed to be sleeping soundly   had he been mistaken    chapter x.x.i.i. the shadow of treason when the soldiers jumped from their bunks the next morning at the call of the bugle frank's comrades saw his bandaged head and they surrounded him at once with expressions of solicitude and alarm   
what's the matter old man    asked bart anxiously   don't say you're badly hurt    exclaimed tom you look all in said billy   
you're as pale as a ghost   i'm a long way from being a ghost yet smiled frank as he drew on his clothes   wait till you see me tuck away the grub at breakfast   i butted my head against a stump last night to find out which was the harder and the stump won   
stop your kidding and tell us about it commanded bart   frank told them the main features of his encounter of the night before but it was only after mess when he had them by themselves that he voiced his suspicions of rabig   tom gave a long whistle   that fellow will queer this whole outfit yet he blurted out   
he's a sneak and a traitor   if he had his deserts he'd be up against the firing squad within twenty four hours   easy there tom counseled frank looking around him for in his excitement tom had raised his voice   remember i'm not dead sure   
i wouldn't swear to it in a court of law   here comes nick himself remarked bart   the old nick growled tom hello rabig said frank as the former camport bully came along   rabig grunted a surly hello in reply and was passing on when billy hailed him   
sleep well last night rabig    he asked carelessly   rabig's face flushed and a frightened look came into his eyes   sure i did he snapped   
why shouldn't i    no reason in the world replied billy   these cool nights are fine for sleeping remarked tom a little too cool to be out in the woods but just right for the trench   rabig seemed to be trying to think up a reply but nothing came to him and he simply stood still and glowered at them   
he appeared to be speculating   what significance was there in these apparently careless questions    why should they be asked at all    how much did these cordially hated acquaintances of his really know   
 i hear that one of the germans was killed close to our lines last night said billy shifting the attack   right inside our lines corrected tom and here's the fellow who shot him pointing to frank   frank has nerve drawled billy   rabig shot a glare of hate that was not lost by the onlookers who kept their eyes steadily on his face   
he nearly got another one too observed bart   and the funny thing about it was that he thought he knew the fellow's voice   this was coming too near for rabig to pretend that he did not know what they were driving at   he turned upon them in desperation   
look here he snarled viciously   what do you fellows mean    if you mean that i'm mixed up in this thing you lie   now don't you speak to me again or i'll make you sorry for it   
without waiting for a reply he hurried off and the four camport chums looked after him with speculation in their eyes until he was lost to view at a turn of the trench   he's guilty all right declared tom with conviction   if ever guilt looked out of a man's eyes they looked out of his agreed bart   it seems so admitted frank with reluctance and yet he was in his bunk when i went through last night   
how do you know it was rabig    tom retorted   are you such a cute detective that you can tell one man's snore from another    who else could it have been   
 asked frank   if it was some one else that some one else must have been in cahoots with rabig and agreed to make him seem to be in his bunk   i'd hate to think that there was more than one traitor in the regiment   one's more than enough agreed bart   
what do you think we ought to do about it    asked billy   i don't know replied frank with a worried look on his face   it would be a terrible thing to accuse a man wrongfully of such a thing as treason   
rabig would simply deny it and put it up to us to prove it   then too every one knows that there's no love lost between us and nick and they might think we were too ready to believe evil of him without real proof   on the other hand replied tom if we let him go on we may wake up some time to find that rabig has done the regiment more harm than a german battery could do   we'll simply have to keep our eyes peeled was billy's solution of the problem and watch that fellow like hawks   
but if he makes one more bad break i don't think we ought to keep silent any longer   let's hope that next time if there is any next time we'll have the goods on him so that there can't be any denying it   but pleasanter thoughts diverted their attention just then for the camp postman came into view and the boys rose with a whoop and pounced upon their letters   and all their spare time that morning was spent in reading and rereading the precious missives from their friends so many thousand miles away   
frank was poring over a letter from his mother for the tenth time when he heard his name spoken and looked up to see colonel pavet who was passing along in the company of another officer   he had only a moment to spare but that moment was given to frank who had risen and greeted him with a welcome as warm as his own   ah monsieur sheldon letters from home i see he remarked   i hope your mother is well   
very well thank you responded frank   and very grateful to you colonel pavet for the interest you have taken in her behalf and mine   the colonel courteously waved the thanks aside   he replied   
but you can tell madame sheldon that her affairs are progressing finely though not as rapidly as they would if it were not for the distracted state of france   for instance my brother andre has been trying to get a furlough for a man who was formerly a butler in the de latour family and whose evidence he thinks will be most important in establishing your mother's right   it is only with the greatest difficulty that i have been able to bring this about but i have succeeded at last and the man will go to auvergne next week to give his testimony   let us hope that it will be as valuable as andre thinks   
again frank expressed his thanks and after a few more words they parted   vive la france    exclaimed frank as he saluted   vive l'amerique   
 returned the colonel   chapter x.x.i.i.i. a hail of lead it's coming declared tom a few days later as the boys were getting ready to go to mess   listen to the oracle mocked bart   what's coming   
 christmas    inquired billy   the big fight replied tom hear the general gibed bart   i've understood that tom was general pershing's right bower put in billy   
they say he doesn't do a thing without him said bart   it's a pity that tom didn't live in napoleon's time laughed frank   he'd have been a marshal sure   napoleon repeated billy with a faraway look in his eyes   
where have i heard that name before    the four friends laughed as the comical scene in the little french village rose up before them   but with all their jesting they felt as sure as tom that a big battle was impending   one did not have to be an officer to know that   
the rank and file could tell it just as unerringly as their superiors   for many days past all arms of the service had been working at top speed   regiments and divisions had been reorganized and brought up to their full strength   reserves had been brought from distant portions of the line and were massed heavily in the rear of the positions   
raiding parties were active on both sides as each was eager to get prisoners and information and scarcely a night passed without heavy skirmishes between patrols that in former days would have risen to the dignity of battles   overhead the sky was dotted with the planes of the rival forces and the hum of the motors of the giant birds of prey was continuous   they fought not only in single combat but in sauacfrons and the sight of one or more whirling down in flames was so common that it scarcely attracted attention   and most ominous of all the medical service was organizing gigantic units close to the front in anticipation of the harvest of blood and wounds that was so close at hand   
yes a battle was coming   the grim reaper was sharpening his scythe and the watching world was waiting for the outcome in an agony of expectation   the forces as far as known were evenly balanced though it was rumored that the germans were drawing large reserves temporarily from the eastern front and color was lent to this by the fact that the swiss frontier had been closed for a month to conceal the movement of troops   it was not yet certain which side would make the first move   
each army was drawn up in a strong natural position with ranges of hills behind in the event of having to fall back   i hope we get in the first blow remarked frank as he discussed the question with his chums   so do i agreed bart   you know then where you're going to strike   
this matter of fighting behind entanglements doesn't make a hit with me at all   there's more of a swing and rush to it when you attack commented billy   do you remember how it was fellows in that last big scrap when we were sprinting over no man's land    you're so eager to get at the huns that you don't have time to think of danger   
but one foggy morning not long after the german leaders settled the matter for the camport strategists and struck with tremendous force at the allied lines   two hours before dawn the german guns opened up with a roar that shook the earth   the air was full of flying shells tear shells to blind the eyes of the allied gunners so that they could not see to serve their pieces mustard shells that bit into the lungs like a consuming fire chlorine gas shells with a deadly poison to cause such agony that even surgeons hardened in the exercise of their profession turned away their faces from the writhings of the victims   then following these a storm of leaden hail withering searing blasting before which it seemed no living thing could stand   
crouched low in their trenches massed line behind line the allied forces bent their heads to the storm and waited in grim fury for the infantry attack that they knew would surely follow   and it was not long in coming   the fog had risen by this time and over the fields rank upon rank marching at the double quick came masses of gray figures that seemed as endless as the waves of the sea   the allied artillery tore wide gaps in the dense masses but they closed up instantly and continued their advance   
machine guns poured thousands of bullets into the living target and the gunners served their pieces again and again until they were so hot that they burned the hand   but true to their theory of warfare the german leaders fed their men into the jaws of moloch with cynical indifference   they had counted on paying a certain price and they were willing to pay it   but flesh and blood has its limitations and before that murderous fire the ranks at last faltered   
then from the trenches poured the allied hosts in a fierce counter attack and before their resistless charge the enemy wavered and at last broke   the gray lines melted away and the ground strewn with their dead and dying was held by the allied forces which swiftly organized for the second attack that they knew would not be long in coming   chapter x.x.i.v. a deed of daring we got them    cried bart exultingly as the boys worked feverishly at the preparations to meet the new attack   
right between the eyes cried billy   we drew first blood all right agreed frank but they'll come again for more   the prophecy was speedily realized for again the enemy came forward with undiminished ardor protected this time by a deadly barrage fire behind which they marched with confidence   it was evident that this time the enemy having tested the allied mettle and found it excellent had determined to place its chief reliance upon their big gun fire   
and for a time it seemed as though their confidence was justified   the barrage fire swept the ground so completely that the allies were forced to abandon their hastily seized positions in the open and retreat once more to the shelter of their trenches   but all the attacks of the german hordes repeated again and again were not able to get possession of those first line trenches to which the allies held with the fury of desperation   they were manned chiefly by the american troops although certain units of french and english held either end of the line   
again and again the storm broke and again and again it was beaten back   the germans had massed at that portion of the line numbers many times greater than those possessed by the defenders   by all the theories of war they ought to have been successful but like the old guard at waterloo the americans might die but would not surrender   yet after a while the very stubbornness of this resistance proved in itself a danger   
on the right and the left the line though not broken was bent back   in this way the american position formed a salient in the german line and was subjected to attack not only in front but on the flanks   it became imperative that the line should draw back so that it might be in keeping with the position now held by the wings   so after hours of sanguinary fighting the orders came to fall back and the americans who had been standing like the army of thomas at chickamauga fifty years previous reluctantly obeyed and fell slowly back to new positions their faces always toward the foe   
what kind of a fool stunt is this    growled tom who with his comrades had been in the thick of the fight   we had it all over those fellows even if they were two or three times as many and here we are retreating when we ought to go ahead and lick the tar out of them   don't growl and complain tom soothed frank whose left hand was bleeding where a bullet had zipped its way across it   
they'll get the licking all right when the time comes   it's good dope to give back a little sometimes added bart   it's like boxing   when a blow comes straight at your stomach you bend back and that takes half the force away from the blow   
don't worry the least little bit about this fight   we may be bending a little but we're not breaking and before many hours we'll be standing the heinies on their heads   but the promise was not fulfilled that day and when night came after hours of tremendous struggle the allied forces had not regained their lost ground   as darkness fell the combat lessened and finally ceased altogether as far as infantry attacks were concerned although all through the night the artillery kept up a fire of greater or less intensity   
the boys of the regiment to which the camport boys belonged were in rather a sober mood when they gathered around their field kitchens that night and partook of the food that was served out to them   they had not lost a gun but they had yielded ground and a great many of their comrades would never again answer the roll call   but their fighting spirit was at as high a pitch as ever and they could scarcely wait till the morrow to get their revenge   frank and his chums had come through the day unscathed except for the injury to frank's hand and a mark across billy's temple where a bullet had ridged the skin   
perhaps it was due to the fortune that is said to attend the brave for they had borne themselves like heroes and had been stationed at one of the most fiercely battered portions of the line   i suppose they're gloating over this in berlin to night said tom gloomily as they sat at the roots of a great tree whose bark and branches had been stripped from it by a storm of shells   and groaning over it in new york added billy   he laughs best who laughs last said bart   
to morrow's a new day   just watch our smoke   we'll eat em alive prophesied frank confidently as he nursed his wounded hand   like john paul jones we've just begun to fight   
do you fellows remember what general corse said one time when sherman asked him if he could hold out    asked bart   what was it    asked billy   
he said i've lost one eye and a piece of an ear but i can lick a brigade or two yet answered bart   good old scout approved billy while the boys laughed   well we're not as badly off as that yet said frank although this hand of mine is smarting to beat the band   and my head is aching ready to split added billy   
one inch to the left and it would have been all up with your uncle billy   the fighting was resumed at dawn and again it was the germans who attacked   they had counted on their advantage of the day before to break the morale of their enemies and hoped by pressure to turn the withdrawal into a rout   but like so many german calculations since the beginning of the war they had figured badly   
the allies stung by their discomfiture of the day before fought like tigers   they beat the germans back and took the offensive in their own hands   the germans retreated though staunchly contesting every foot of ground   in the front of frank's company the enemy had established a machine gun nest that was particularly effective   
again and again the americans sought to clean them out but were met with such a galling fire that they lost heavily and at last the captain decided that the guns were not worth the price he was paying to get possession of them   yet the position would be of so much advantage if captured that he hesitated at changing his course and choosing another line of advance   in the litter and wreck of the field frank's keen eye had caught sight of two big barrels filled with clothing for the troops   the barrels had been dropped from a wrecked motor lorry of a supply train   
like a flash an inspiration came to him   he consulted a moment with bart whose eye lighted up as he nodded assent   then he stepped up to his captain and saluted   chapter x.x.v. storming the ridge what is it sheldon   
 i think i can silence those guns sir frank said   a light came into the captain's eyes   how    he asked   
in a few brief words frank described his plan   but it's suicide protested the captain   there isn't one chance in a thousand that you'll come out alive   i know said frank   
but raymond and i are willing to risk it if you give the word   the captain pondered for a moment   it was a forlorn hope but forlorn hopes sometimes won out   go ahead he said   
frank nodded to bart and in a twinkling they had turned the big barrels over on their sides   then each lay on the ground behind his barrel and began to push it toward the enemy   the men of their company had watched them wonderingly while they made their preparations and when they realized what the boys had in mind they raised a thundering cheer that rose above the din of battle   the crews of the two enemy machine guns looked with stupefaction at the big barrels coming toward them   
then they woke from their trance and a storm of bullets beat upon the barrels   if they had been empty the bullets would have gone through and killed the boys behind them   but they were filled with woolen clothing which while light enough to enable the boys to push the barrels with comparative ease was just the thing to stop the bullets   the whizzing missiles thudded into the clothing and there they stopped   
it was on the same basis as the sandbag which stops a cannon ball that would go through an iron plate   steadily the boys kept on pushing the barrels before them   they did not go on hands and knees for then they would be exposed to the enemy bullets   it was a caterpillar motion drawing their bodies along the ground and was a tremendous tax on their muscles for they could get no purchase   
one thing in their favor was that the ground sloped a trifle toward the enemy position and this made the barrels roll more easily   by this time the enemy was growing frantic at this novel method of attack   they could not see their enemy and they could not kill him   and the sight of those barrels coming toward them as inexorably as fate got on their nerves already tense with the fury of the combat   
nearer and nearer came the barrels to the guns until they were not more than twenty feet away   then they stopped   the german gunners drew fresh hope from this   had their bullets found their mark in the bodies of their daring enemies   
 but there were two very live boys behind those motionless barrels   frank and bart had drawn a handful of grenades from their sacks   at a given signal they drew back their arms and hurled them over the barrels in quick succession   they fell right in the midst of the machine guns   
there was a tremendous explosion that killed some of the gunners and threw the rest into wild confusion   now    shouted frank and he and bart leaped to their feet and rushed toward the guns   there was a wild melee for a moment and then the surviving germans turned and ran in panic down the slope   
the boys slued the captured guns around and sent a stream of bullets after their wildly fleeing enemies   the rout was complete and the next minute the whole company that had charged the instant the grenades were thrown came tearing up and there was a scene of hilarity and enthusiasm that passed description   the finest thing i ever saw    declared the captain   
you boys are the stuff of which heroes are made   but there was no time then to dwell on the exploit   the enemy was on the run and they must keep him going   and they did so well and so thoroughly that when the day was over they had swept the whole ridge that had been their objective in the fight and planted old glory on its highest crest   
and their victory was shared by the rest of the allied line who not only regained all the losses of the day before but swept the germans out of their first and second lines on a five mile front inflicting on them a defeat which they were long to remember   and how the lesson that the germans learned that day was repeated later on will be told in the next book of this series entitled army boys on the firing line or holding back the german drive   not but what the victory had cost the americans dearly   every regiment engaged had its own long list of killed and wounded   
poor old fred said frank referring to anderson   his right arm was badly shattered and i'm afraid he may lose it   fred is playing in hard luck returned bart   that's twice he's been wounded   
remember the night down at the old mill when the bomb got his leg    he's having more than his share agreed billy   there's wilson too said bart   he's been in the thick of it all day but he went down with a bullet in his shoulder just as we got to the top of the ridge   
the corp certainly fought like a tiger said tom but he's worth a dozen dead men yet   a month in the hospital will fix him up all right i hope   there's one good thing anyway pat in billy   the huns haven't taken many of our boys prisoners   
and we've got more of their men than we know what to do with exulted frank   i know what i'd do with them said tom i'd send them to america to be imprisoned there and i'd put a bunch of them on every transport that sailed to the other side   that wouldn't be a bad stunt agreed bart   then if a submarine sank the ship it would carry a lot of their own people down to davy jones   
among the missing was one whose loss did not greatly grieve the boys of the old thirty seventh nick rabig did not answer to his name when the roll was called   they did not find his body on the field nor was he among the wounded that were brought in and tenderly cared for in the hospitals   i see nick is missing remarked frank to bart later in the evening as they were resting and rejoicing over the victory   missing but not missed put in the implacable tom if the huns have got him he'll feel more at home than he ever felt with us remarked bart   
maybe he was captured against his will said tom and then again maybe what do you suppose they'll say in camport when they hear of this day's work fellows    asked billy   oh answered frank with a laugh they'll only say it's nothing more than we expected   they know us don't they   
 of course they do broke in tom we came to france to do our duty as american citizens as well as soldiers   i wonder how long it will be before this war is over and we start for home    came from frank   not tired of the game yet are you   
 quizzed billy quickly   do i look as if i was tired of it    was the counter question we are all going to stay over here until the huns are licked good and proper    burst cut bart   
there is no use in stopping while the job is only half finished   just you wait until uncle sam has a lot of men over here put in billy   then we'll show those huns what's what and don't you forget it    we'll wallop them so thoroughly they'll be getting down on their knees yelling for mercy   
now you've said something    came in a chorus from the others   and here let us say good bye to the army boys
