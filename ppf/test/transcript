the family of dashwood had long been settled in sussex  their estate was large and their residence was at norland park in the centre of their property where for many generations they had lived in so respectable a manner as to engage the general good opinion of their surrounding acquaintance  the late owner of this estate was a single man who lived to a very advanced age and who for many years of his life had a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister  but her death which happened ten years before his own produced a great alteration in his home for to supply her loss he invited and received into his house the family of his nephew mr henry dashwood the legal inheritor of the norland estate and the person to whom he intended to bequeath it  in the society of his nephew and niece and their children the old gentlemans days were comfortably spent  his attachment to them all increased  the constant attention of mr and mrs henry dashwood to his wishes which proceeded not merely from interest but from goodness of heart gave him every degree of solid comfort which his age could receive and the cheerfulness of the children added a relish to his existence

by a former marriage mr henry dashwood had one son by his present
lady three daughters  the son a steady respectable young man was
amply provided for by the fortune of his mother which had been large
and half of which devolved on him on his coming of age  by his own
marriage likewise which happened soon afterwards he added to his
wealth  to him therefore the succession to the norland estate was not
so really important as to his sisters for their fortune independent
of what might arise to them from their fathers inheriting that
property could be but small  their mother had nothing and their
father only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal for the
remaining moiety of his first wifes fortune was also secured to her
child and he had only a lifeinterest in it

the old gentleman died his will was read and like almost every other
will gave as much disappointment as pleasure  he was neither so
unjust nor so ungrateful as to leave his estate from his nephewbut
he left it to him on such terms as destroyed half the value of the
bequest  mr dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his wife
and daughters than for himself or his sonbut to his son and his
sons son a child of four years old it was secured in such a way as
to leave to himself no power of providing for those who were most dear
to him and who most needed a provision by any charge on the estate or
by any sale of its valuable woods  the whole was tied up for the
benefit of this child who in occasional visits with his father and
mother at norland had so far gained on the affections of his uncle by
such attractions as are by no means unusual in children of two or three
years old an imperfect articulation an earnest desire of having his
own way many cunning tricks and a great deal of noise as to outweigh
all the value of all the attention which for years he had received
from his niece and her daughters  he meant not to be unkind however
and as a mark of his affection for the three girls he left them a
thousand pounds apiece

mr dashwoods disappointment was at first severe but his temper was
cheerful and sanguine and he might reasonably hope to live many years
and by living economically lay by a considerable sum from the produce
of an estate already large and capable of almost immediate
improvement  but the fortune which had been so tardy in coming was
his only one twelvemonth  he survived his uncle no longer and ten
thousand pounds including the late legacies was all that remained for
his widow and daughters

his son was sent for as soon as his danger was known and to him mr
dashwood recommended with all the strength and urgency which illness
could command the interest of his motherinlaw and sisters

mr john dashwood had not the strong feelings of the rest of the
family but he was affected by a recommendation of such a nature at
such a time and he promised to do every thing in his power to make
them comfortable  his father was rendered easy by such an assurance
and mr john dashwood had then leisure to consider how much there might
prudently be in his power to do for them

he was not an illdisposed young man unless to be rather cold hearted
and rather selfish is to be illdisposed but he was in general well
respected for he conducted himself with propriety in the discharge of
his ordinary duties  had he married a more amiable woman he might
have been made still more respectable than he washe might even have
been made amiable himself for he was very young when he married and
very fond of his wife  but mrs john dashwood was a strong caricature
of himselfmore narrowminded and selfish

when he gave his promise to his father he meditated within himself to
increase the fortunes of his sisters by the present of a thousand
pounds apiece  he then really thought himself equal to it  the
prospect of four thousand ayear in addition to his present income
besides the remaining half of his own mothers fortune warmed his
heart and made him feel capable of generosity yes he would give
them three thousand pounds it would be liberal and handsome it would
be enough to make them completely easy  three thousand pounds he
could spare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience he
thought of it all day long and for many days successively and he did
not repent

no sooner was his fathers funeral over than mrs john dashwood
without sending any notice of her intention to her motherinlaw
arrived with her child and their attendants  no one could dispute her
right to come the house was her husbands from the moment of his
fathers decease but the indelicacy of her conduct was so much the
greater and to a woman in mrs dashwoods situation with only common
feelings must have been highly unpleasingbut in her mind there was
a sense of honor so keen a generosity so romantic that any offence of
the kind by whomsoever given or received was to her a source of
immovable disgust  mrs john dashwood had never been a favourite with
any of her husbands family but she had had no opportunity till the
present of shewing them with how little attention to the comfort of
other people she could act when occasion required it

so acutely did mrs dashwood feel this ungracious behaviour and so
earnestly did she despise her daughterinlaw for it that on the
arrival of the latter she would have quitted the house for ever had
not the entreaty of her eldest girl induced her first to reflect on the
propriety of going and her own tender love for all her three children
determined her afterwards to stay and for their sakes avoid a breach
with their brother

elinor this eldest daughter whose advice was so effectual possessed
a strength of understanding and coolness of judgment which qualified
her though only nineteen to be the counsellor of her mother and
enabled her frequently to counteract to the advantage of them all
that eagerness of mind in mrs dashwood which must generally have led
to imprudence  she had an excellent hearther disposition was
affectionate and her feelings were strong but she knew how to govern
them it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn and which
one of her sisters had resolved never to be taught

mariannes abilities were in many respects quite equal to elinors
she was sensible and clever but eager in everything her sorrows her
joys could have no moderation  she was generous amiable
interesting she was everything but prudent  the resemblance between
her and her mother was strikingly great

elinor saw with concern the excess of her sisters sensibility but
by mrs dashwood it was valued and cherished  they encouraged each
other now in the violence of their affliction  the agony of grief
which overpowered them at first was voluntarily renewed was sought
for was created again and again  they gave themselves up wholly to
their sorrow seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that
could afford it and resolved against ever admitting consolation in
future  elinor too was deeply afflicted but still she could
struggle she could exert herself  she could consult with her brother
could receive her sisterinlaw on her arrival and treat her with
proper attention and could strive to rouse her mother to similar
exertion and encourage her to similar forbearance

margaret the other sister was a goodhumored welldisposed girl but
as she had already imbibed a good deal of mariannes romance without
having much of her sense she did not at thirteen bid fair to equal
her sisters at a more advanced period of life



chapter 2


mrs john dashwood now installed herself mistress of norland and her
mother and sistersinlaw were degraded to the condition of visitors
as such however they were treated by her with quiet civility and by
her husband with as much kindness as he could feel towards anybody
beyond himself his wife and their child  he really pressed them
with some earnestness to consider norland as their home and as no
plan appeared so eligible to mrs dashwood as remaining there till she
could accommodate herself with a house in the neighbourhood his
invitation was accepted

a continuance in a place where everything reminded her of former
delight was exactly what suited her mind  in seasons of cheerfulness
no temper could be more cheerful than hers or possess in a greater
degree that sanguine expectation of happiness which is happiness
itself  but in sorrow she must be equally carried away by her fancy
and as far beyond consolation as in pleasure she was beyond alloy

mrs john dashwood did not at all approve of what her husband intended
to do for his sisters  to take three thousand pounds from the fortune
of their dear little boy would be impoverishing him to the most
dreadful degree  she begged him to think again on the subject  how
could he answer it to himself to rob his child and his only child too
of so large a sum  and what possible claim could the miss dashwoods
who were related to him only by half blood which she considered as no
relationship at all have on his generosity to so large an amount  it
was very well known that no affection was ever supposed to exist
between the children of any man by different marriages and why was he
to ruin himself and their poor little harry by giving away all his
money to his half sisters

it was my fathers last request to me replied her husband that i
should assist his widow and daughters

he did not know what he was talking of i dare say ten to one but he
was lightheaded at the time  had he been in his right senses he
could not have thought of such a thing as begging you to give away half
your fortune from your own child

he did not stipulate for any particular sum my dear fanny he only
requested me in general terms to assist them and make their
situation more comfortable than it was in his power to do  perhaps it
would have been as well if he had left it wholly to myself  he could
hardly suppose i should neglect them  but as he required the promise
i could not do less than give it at least i thought so at the time
the promise therefore was given and must be performed  something
must be done for them whenever they leave norland and settle in a new
home

well then let something be done for them but that something need
not be three thousand pounds  consider she added that when the
money is once parted with it never can return  your sisters will
marry and it will be gone for ever  if indeed it could be restored
to our poor little boy

why to be sure said her husband very gravely that would make
great difference  the time may come when harry will regret that so
large a sum was parted with  if he should have a numerous family for
instance it would be a very convenient addition

to be sure it would

perhaps then it would be better for all parties if the sum were
diminished one halffive hundred pounds would be a prodigious
increase to their fortunes

oh beyond anything great  what brother on earth would do half so
much for his sisters even if really his sisters  and as it isonly
half bloodbut you have such a generous spirit

i would not wish to do any thing mean he replied  one had rather
on such occasions do too much than too little  no one at least can
think i have not done enough for them even themselves they can hardly
expect more

there is no knowing what they may expect said the lady but we are
not to think of their expectations the question is what you can
afford to do

certainlyand i think i may afford to give them five hundred pounds
apiece  as it is without any addition of mine they will each have
about three thousand pounds on their mothers deatha very comfortable
fortune for any young woman

to be sure it is and indeed it strikes me that they can want no
addition at all  they will have ten thousand pounds divided amongst
them  if they marry they will be sure of doing well and if they do
not they may all live very comfortably together on the interest of ten
thousand pounds

that is very true and therefore i do not know whether upon the
whole it would not be more advisable to do something for their mother
while she lives rather than for themsomething of the annuity kind i
meanmy sisters would feel the good effects of it as well as herself
a hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable

his wife hesitated a little however in giving her consent to this
plan

to be sure said she it is better than parting with fifteen hundred
pounds at once  but then if mrs dashwood should live fifteen years
we shall be completely taken in

fifteen years my dear fanny her life cannot be worth half that
purchase

certainly not but if you observe people always live for ever when
there is an annuity to be paid them and she is very stout and healthy
and hardly forty  an annuity is a very serious business it comes over
and over every year and there is no getting rid of it  you are not
aware of what you are doing  i have known a great deal of the trouble
of annuities for my mother was clogged with the payment of three to
old superannuated servants by my fathers will and it is amazing how
disagreeable she found it  twice every year these annuities were to be
paid and then there was the trouble of getting it to them and then
one of them was said to have died and afterwards it turned out to be
no such thing  my mother was quite sick of it  her income was not her
own she said with such perpetual claims on it and it was the more
unkind in my father because otherwise the money would have been
entirely at my mothers disposal without any restriction whatever  it
has given me such an abhorrence of annuities that i am sure i would
not pin myself down to the payment of one for all the world

it is certainly an unpleasant thing replied mr dashwood to have
those kind of yearly drains on ones income  ones fortune as your
mother justly says is not ones own  to be tied down to the regular
payment of such a sum on every rent day is by no means desirable it
takes away ones independence

undoubtedly and after all you have no thanks for it  they think
themselves secure you do no more than what is expected and it raises
no gratitude at all  if i were you whatever i did should be done at
my own discretion entirely  i would not bind myself to allow them any
thing yearly  it may be very inconvenient some years to spare a
hundred or even fifty pounds from our own expenses

i believe you are right my love it will be better that there should
be no annuity in the case whatever i may give them occasionally will
be of far greater assistance than a yearly allowance because they
would only enlarge their style of living if they felt sure of a larger
income and would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end of the
year  it will certainly be much the best way  a present of fifty
pounds now and then will prevent their ever being distressed for
money and will i think be amply discharging my promise to my father

to be sure it will  indeed to say the truth i am convinced within
myself that your father had no idea of your giving them any money at
all  the assistance he thought of i dare say was only such as might
be reasonably expected of you for instance such as looking out for a
comfortable small house for them helping them to move their things
and sending them presents of fish and game and so forth whenever they
are in season  ill lay my life that he meant nothing farther indeed
it would be very strange and unreasonable if he did  do but consider
my dear mr dashwood how excessively comfortable your motherinlaw
and her daughters may live on the interest of seven thousand pounds
besides the thousand pounds belonging to each of the girls which
brings them in fifty pounds a year apiece and of course they will
pay their mother for their board out of it  altogether they will have
five hundred ayear amongst them and what on earth can four women want
for more than thatthey will live so cheap their housekeeping will
be nothing at all  they will have no carriage no horses and hardly
any servants they will keep no company and can have no expenses of
any kind  only conceive how comfortable they will be  five hundred a
year i am sure i cannot imagine how they will spend half of it and as
to your giving them more it is quite absurd to think of it  they will
be much more able to give you something

upon my word said mr dashwood i believe you are perfectly right
my father certainly could mean nothing more by his request to me than
what you say  i clearly understand it now and i will strictly fulfil
my engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness to them as you
have described  when my mother removes into another house my services
shall be readily given to accommodate her as far as i can  some little
present of furniture too may be acceptable then

certainly returned mrs john dashwood  but however one thing
must be considered  when your father and mother moved to norland
though the furniture of stanhill was sold all the china plate and
linen was saved and is now left to your mother  her house will
therefore be almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it

that is a material consideration undoubtedly  a valuable legacy
indeed and yet some of the plate would have been a very pleasant
addition to our own stock here

yes and the set of breakfast china is twice as handsome as what
belongs to this house  a great deal too handsome in my opinion for
any place they can ever afford to live in  but however so it is
your father thought only of them  and i must say this that you owe no
particular gratitude to him nor attention to his wishes for we very
well know that if he could he would have left almost everything in the
world to them

this argument was irresistible  it gave to his intentions whatever of
decision was wanting before and he finally resolved that it would be
absolutely unnecessary if not highly indecorous to do more for the
widow and children of his father than such kind of neighbourly acts as
his own wife pointed out



chapter 3


mrs dashwood remained at norland several months not from any
disinclination to move when the sight of every well known spot ceased
to raise the violent emotion which it produced for a while for when
her spirits began to revive and her mind became capable of some other
exertion than that of heightening its affliction by melancholy
remembrances she was impatient to be gone and indefatigable in her
inquiries for a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood of norland for
to remove far from that beloved spot was impossible  but she could
hear of no situation that at once answered her notions of comfort and
ease and suited the prudence of her eldest daughter whose steadier
judgment rejected several houses as too large for their income which
her mother would have approved

mrs dashwood had been informed by her husband of the solemn promise on
the part of his son in their favour which gave comfort to his last
earthly reflections  she doubted the sincerity of this assurance no
more than he had doubted it himself and she thought of it for her
daughters sake with satisfaction though as for herself she was
persuaded that a much smaller provision than 7000l would support her in
affluence  for their brothers sake too for the sake of his own
heart she rejoiced and she reproached herself for being unjust to his
merit before in believing him incapable of generosity  his attentive
behaviour to herself and his sisters convinced her that their welfare
was dear to him and for a long time she firmly relied on the
liberality of his intentions

the contempt which she had very early in their acquaintance felt for
her daughterinlaw was very much increased by the farther knowledge
of her character which half a years residence in her family afforded
and perhaps in spite of every consideration of politeness or maternal
affection on the side of the former the two ladies might have found it
impossible to have lived together so long had not a particular
circumstance occurred to give still greater eligibility according to
the opinions of mrs dashwood to her daughters continuance at norland

this circumstance was a growing attachment between her eldest girl and
the brother of mrs john dashwood a gentlemanlike and pleasing young
man who was introduced to their acquaintance soon after his sisters
establishment at norland and who had since spent the greatest part of
his time there

some mothers might have encouraged the intimacy from motives of
interest for edward ferrars was the eldest son of a man who had died
very rich and some might have repressed it from motives of prudence
for except a trifling sum the whole of his fortune depended on the
will of his mother  but mrs dashwood was alike uninfluenced by either
consideration  it was enough for her that he appeared to be amiable
that he loved her daughter and that elinor returned the partiality
it was contrary to every doctrine of hers that difference of fortune
should keep any couple asunder who were attracted by resemblance of
disposition and that elinors merit should not be acknowledged by
every one who knew her was to her comprehension impossible

edward ferrars was not recommended to their good opinion by any
peculiar graces of person or address  he was not handsome and his
manners required intimacy to make them pleasing  he was too diffident
to do justice to himself but when his natural shyness was overcome
his behaviour gave every indication of an open affectionate heart
his understanding was good and his education had given it solid
improvement  but he was neither fitted by abilities nor disposition to
answer the wishes of his mother and sister who longed to see him
distinguishedasthey hardly knew what  they wanted him to make a
fine figure in the world in some manner or other  his mother wished to
interest him in political concerns to get him into parliament or to
see him connected with some of the great men of the day  mrs john
dashwood wished it likewise but in the mean while till one of these
superior blessings could be attained it would have quieted her
ambition to see him driving a barouche  but edward had no turn for
great men or barouches  all his wishes centered in domestic comfort
and the quiet of private life  fortunately he had a younger brother
who was more promising

edward had been staying several weeks in the house before he engaged
much of mrs dashwoods attention for she was at that time in such
affliction as rendered her careless of surrounding objects  she saw
only that he was quiet and unobtrusive and she liked him for it  he
did not disturb the wretchedness of her mind by illtimed conversation
she was first called to observe and approve him farther by a
reflection which elinor chanced one day to make on the difference
between him and his sister  it was a contrast which recommended him
most forcibly to her mother

it is enough said she to say that he is unlike fanny is enough
it implies everything amiable  i love him already

i think you will like him said elinor when you know more of him

like him replied her mother with a smile  i feel no sentiment of
approbation inferior to love

you may esteem him

i have never yet known what it was to separate esteem and love

mrs dashwood now took pains to get acquainted with him  her manners
were attaching and soon banished his reserve  she speedily
comprehended all his merits the persuasion of his regard for elinor
perhaps assisted her penetration but she really felt assured of his
worth and even that quietness of manner which militated against all
her established ideas of what a young mans address ought to be was no
longer uninteresting when she knew his heart to be warm and his temper
affectionate

no sooner did she perceive any symptom of love in his behaviour to
elinor than she considered their serious attachment as certain and
looked forward to their marriage as rapidly approaching

in a few months my dear marianne said she elinor will in all
probability be settled for life  we shall miss her but she will be
happy

oh mama how shall we do without her

my love it will be scarcely a separation  we shall live within a few
miles of each other and shall meet every day of our lives  you will
gain a brother a real affectionate brother  i have the highest
opinion in the world of edwards heart  but you look grave marianne
do you disapprove your sisters choice

perhaps said marianne i may consider it with some surprise
edward is very amiable and i love him tenderly  but yethe is not
the kind of young manthere is something wantinghis figure is not
striking it has none of that grace which i should expect in the man
who could seriously attach my sister  his eyes want all that spirit
that fire which at once announce virtue and intelligence  and besides
all this i am afraid mama he has no real taste  music seems
scarcely to attract him and though he admires elinors drawings very
much it is not the admiration of a person who can understand their
worth  it is evident in spite of his frequent attention to her while
she draws that in fact he knows nothing of the matter  he admires as
a lover not as a connoisseur  to satisfy me those characters must be
united  i could not be happy with a man whose taste did not in every
point coincide with my own  he must enter into all my feelings the
same books the same music must charm us both  oh mama how
spiritless how tame was edwards manner in reading to us last night
i felt for my sister most severely  yet she bore it with so much
composure she seemed scarcely to notice it  i could hardly keep my
seat  to hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almost
driven me wild pronounced with such impenetrable calmness such
dreadful indifference he would certainly have done more justice to
simple and elegant prose  i thought so at the time but you would give
him cowper

nay mama if he is not to be animated by cowperbut we must allow
for difference of taste  elinor has not my feelings and therefore she
may overlook it and be happy with him  but it would have broke my
heart had i loved him to hear him read with so little sensibility
mama the more i know of the world the more am i convinced that i
shall never see a man whom i can really love  i require so much  he
must have all edwards virtues and his person and manners must
ornament his goodness with every possible charm

remember my love that you are not seventeen  it is yet too early in
life to despair of such a happiness  why should you be less fortunate
than your mother  in one circumstance only my marianne may your
destiny be different from hers



chapter 4


what a pity it is elinor said marianne that edward should have no
taste for drawing

no taste for drawing replied elinor why should you think so he
does not draw himself indeed but he has great pleasure in seeing the
performances of other people and i assure you he is by no means
deficient in natural taste though he has not had opportunities of
improving it  had he ever been in the way of learning i think he
would have drawn very well  he distrusts his own judgment in such
matters so much that he is always unwilling to give his opinion on any
picture but he has an innate propriety and simplicity of taste which
in general direct him perfectly right

marianne was afraid of offending and said no more on the subject but
the kind of approbation which elinor described as excited in him by the
drawings of other people was very far from that rapturous delight
which in her opinion could alone be called taste  yet though
smiling within herself at the mistake she honoured her sister for that
blind partiality to edward which produced it

i hope marianne continued elinor you do not consider him as
deficient in general taste  indeed i think i may say that you cannot
for your behaviour to him is perfectly cordial and if that were your
opinion i am sure you could never be civil to him

marianne hardly knew what to say  she would not wound the feelings of
her sister on any account and yet to say what she did not believe was
impossible  at length she replied

do not be offended elinor if my praise of him is not in every thing
equal to your sense of his merits  i have not had so many
opportunities of estimating the minuter propensities of his mind his
inclinations and tastes as you have but i have the highest opinion in
the world of his goodness and sense  i think him every thing that is
worthy and amiable

i am sure replied elinor with a smile that his dearest friends
could not be dissatisfied with such commendation as that  i do not
perceive how you could express yourself more warmly

marianne was rejoiced to find her sister so easily pleased

of his sense and his goodness continued elinor no one can i
think be in doubt who has seen him often enough to engage him in
unreserved conversation  the excellence of his understanding and his
principles can be concealed only by that shyness which too often keeps
him silent  you know enough of him to do justice to his solid worth
but of his minuter propensities as you call them you have from
peculiar circumstances been kept more ignorant than myself  he and i
have been at times thrown a good deal together while you have been
wholly engrossed on the most affectionate principle by my mother  i
have seen a great deal of him have studied his sentiments and heard
his opinion on subjects of literature and taste and upon the whole i
venture to pronounce that his mind is wellinformed enjoyment of books
exceedingly great his imagination lively his observation just and
correct and his taste delicate and pure  his abilities in every
respect improve as much upon acquaintance as his manners and person
at first sight his address is certainly not striking and his person
can hardly be called handsome till the expression of his eyes which
are uncommonly good and the general sweetness of his countenance is
perceived  at present i know him so well that i think him really
handsome or at least almost so  what say you marianne

i shall very soon think him handsome elinor if i do not now  when
you tell me to love him as a brother i shall no more see imperfection
in his face than i now do in his heart

elinor started at this declaration and was sorry for the warmth she
had been betrayed into in speaking of him  she felt that edward stood
very high in her opinion  she believed the regard to be mutual but
she required greater certainty of it to make mariannes conviction of
their attachment agreeable to her  she knew that what marianne and her
mother conjectured one moment they believed the nextthat with them
to wish was to hope and to hope was to expect  she tried to explain
the real state of the case to her sister

i do not attempt to deny said she that i think very highly of
himthat i greatly esteem that i like him

marianne here burst forth with indignation

esteem him like him coldhearted elinor oh  worse than
coldhearted ashamed of being otherwise  use those words again and i
will leave the room this moment

elinor could not help laughing  excuse me said she and be assured
that i meant no offence to you by speaking in so quiet a way of my
own feelings  believe them to be stronger than i have declared
believe them in short to be such as his merit and the suspicionthe
hope of his affection for me may warrant without imprudence or folly
but farther than this you must not believe  i am by no means assured
of his regard for me  there are moments when the extent of it seems
doubtful and till his sentiments are fully known you cannot wonder at
my wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own partiality by
believing or calling it more than it is  in my heart i feel
littlescarcely any doubt of his preference  but there are other
points to be considered besides his inclination  he is very far from
being independent  what his mother really is we cannot know but from
fannys occasional mention of her conduct and opinions we have never
been disposed to think her amiable and i am very much mistaken if
edward is not himself aware that there would be many difficulties in
his way if he were to wish to marry a woman who had not either a great
fortune or high rank

marianne was astonished to find how much the imagination of her mother
and herself had outstripped the truth

and you really are not engaged to him said she  yet it certainly
soon will happen  but two advantages will proceed from this delay  i
shall not lose you so soon and edward will have greater opportunity of
improving that natural taste for your favourite pursuit which must be
so indispensably necessary to your future felicity  oh if he should
be so far stimulated by your genius as to learn to draw himself how
delightful it would be

elinor had given her real opinion to her sister  she could not
consider her partiality for edward in so prosperous a state as marianne
had believed it  there was at times a want of spirits about him
which if it did not denote indifference spoke of something almost as
unpromising  a doubt of her regard supposing him to feel it need not
give him more than inquietude  it would not be likely to produce that
dejection of mind which frequently attended him  a more reasonable
cause might be found in the dependent situation which forbade the
indulgence of his affection  she knew that his mother neither behaved
to him so as to make his home comfortable at present nor to give him
any assurance that he might form a home for himself without strictly
attending to her views for his aggrandizement  with such a knowledge
as this it was impossible for elinor to feel easy on the subject  she
was far from depending on that result of his preference of her which
her mother and sister still considered as certain  nay the longer
they were together the more doubtful seemed the nature of his regard
and sometimes for a few painful minutes she believed it to be no more
than friendship

but whatever might really be its limits it was enough when perceived
by his sister to make her uneasy and at the same time which was
still more common to make her uncivil  she took the first
opportunity of affronting her motherinlaw on the occasion talking to
her so expressively of her brothers great expectations of mrs
ferrarss resolution that both her sons should marry well and of the
danger attending any young woman who attempted to draw him in that
mrs dashwood could neither pretend to be unconscious nor endeavor to
be calm  she gave her an answer which marked her contempt and
instantly left the room resolving that whatever might be the
inconvenience or expense of so sudden a removal her beloved elinor
should not be exposed another week to such insinuations

in this state of her spirits a letter was delivered to her from the
post which contained a proposal particularly well timed  it was the
offer of a small house on very easy terms belonging to a relation of
her own a gentleman of consequence and property in devonshire  the
letter was from this gentleman himself and written in the true spirit
of friendly accommodation  he understood that she was in need of a
dwelling and though the house he now offered her was merely a cottage
he assured her that everything should be done to it which she might
think necessary if the situation pleased her  he earnestly pressed
her after giving the particulars of the house and garden to come with
her daughters to barton park the place of his own residence from
whence she might judge herself whether barton cottage for the houses
were in the same parish could by any alteration be made comfortable
to her  he seemed really anxious to accommodate them and the whole of
his letter was written in so friendly a style as could not fail of
giving pleasure to his cousin more especially at a moment when she was
suffering under the cold and unfeeling behaviour of her nearer
connections  she needed no time for deliberation or inquiry  her
resolution was formed as she read  the situation of barton in a
county so far distant from sussex as devonshire which but a few hours
before would have been a sufficient objection to outweigh every
possible advantage belonging to the place was now its first
recommendation  to quit the neighbourhood of norland was no longer an
evil it was an object of desire it was a blessing in comparison of
the misery of continuing her daughterinlaws guest and to remove for
ever from that beloved place would be less painful than to inhabit or
visit it while such a woman was its mistress  she instantly wrote sir
john middleton her acknowledgment of his kindness and her acceptance
of his proposal and then hastened to shew both letters to her
daughters that she might be secure of their approbation before her
answer were sent

elinor had always thought it would be more prudent for them to settle
at some distance from norland than immediately amongst their present
acquaintance  on that head therefore it was not for her to oppose
her mothers intention of removing into devonshire  the house too as
described by sir john was on so simple a scale and the rent so
uncommonly moderate as to leave her no right of objection on either
point and therefore though it was not a plan which brought any charm
to her fancy though it was a removal from the vicinity of norland
beyond her wishes she made no attempt to dissuade her mother from
sending a letter of acquiescence



chapter 5


no sooner was her answer dispatched than mrs dashwood indulged herself
in the pleasure of announcing to her soninlaw and his wife that she
was provided with a house and should incommode them no longer than till
every thing were ready for her inhabiting it they heard her with
surprise mrs john dashwood said nothing but her husband civilly hoped
that she would not be settled far from norland she had great
satisfaction in replying that she was going into devonshireedward
turned hastily towards her on hearing this and in a voice of surprise
and concern which required no explanation to her repeated
devonshire are you indeed going there so far from hence and to
what part of it she explained the situation it was within four miles
northward of exeter

it is but a cottage she continued but i hope to see many of my
friends in it  a room or two can easily be added and if my friends
find no difficulty in travelling so far to see me i am sure i will
find none in accommodating them

she concluded with a very kind invitation to mr and mrs john dashwood
to visit her at barton and to edward she gave one with still greater
affection  though her late conversation with her daughterinlaw had
made her resolve on remaining at norland no longer than was
unavoidable it had not produced the smallest effect on her in that
point to which it principally tended  to separate edward and elinor
was as far from being her object as ever and she wished to show mrs
john dashwood by this pointed invitation to her brother how totally
she disregarded her disapprobation of the match

mr john dashwood told his mother again and again how exceedingly sorry
he was that she had taken a house at such a distance from norland as to
prevent his being of any service to her in removing her furniture  he
really felt conscientiously vexed on the occasion for the very
exertion to which he had limited the performance of his promise to his
father was by this arrangement rendered impracticable the furniture
was all sent around by water  it chiefly consisted of household linen
plate china and books with a handsome pianoforte of mariannes
mrs john dashwood saw the packages depart with a sigh she could not
help feeling it hard that as mrs dashwoods income would be so
trifling in comparison with their own she should have any handsome
article of furniture

mrs dashwood took the house for a twelvemonth it was ready furnished
and she might have immediate possession  no difficulty arose on either
side in the agreement and she waited only for the disposal of her
effects at norland and to determine her future household before she
set off for the west and this as she was exceedingly rapid in the
performance of everything that interested her was soon donethe
horses which were left her by her husband had been sold soon after his
death and an opportunity now offering of disposing of her carriage
she agreed to sell that likewise at the earnest advice of her eldest
daughter  for the comfort of her children had she consulted only her
own wishes she would have kept it but the discretion of elinor
prevailed  her wisdom too limited the number of their servants to
three two maids and a man with whom they were speedily provided from
amongst those who had formed their establishment at norland

the man and one of the maids were sent off immediately into devonshire
to prepare the house for their mistresss arrival for as lady
middleton was entirely unknown to mrs dashwood she preferred going
directly to the cottage to being a visitor at barton park and she
relied so undoubtingly on sir johns description of the house as to
feel no curiosity to examine it herself till she entered it as her own
her eagerness to be gone from norland was preserved from diminution by
the evident satisfaction of her daughterinlaw in the prospect of her
removal a satisfaction which was but feebly attempted to be concealed
under a cold invitation to her to defer her departure  now was the
time when her soninlaws promise to his father might with particular
propriety be fulfilled  since he had neglected to do it on first
coming to the estate their quitting his house might be looked on as
the most suitable period for its accomplishment  but mrs dashwood
began shortly to give over every hope of the kind and to be convinced
from the general drift of his discourse that his assistance extended
no farther than their maintenance for six months at norland  he so
frequently talked of the increasing expenses of housekeeping and of
the perpetual demands upon his purse which a man of any consequence in
the world was beyond calculation exposed to that he seemed rather to
stand in need of more money himself than to have any design of giving
money away

in a very few weeks from the day which brought sir john middletons
first letter to norland every thing was so far settled in their future
abode as to enable mrs dashwood and her daughters to begin their
journey

many were the tears shed by them in their last adieus to a place so
much beloved  dear dear norland said marianne as she wandered
alone before the house on the last evening of their being there when
shall i cease to regret youwhen learn to feel a home elsewhereoh
happy house could you know what i suffer in now viewing you from this
spot from whence perhaps i may view you no moreand you ye
wellknown treesbut you will continue the sameno leaf will decay
because we are removed nor any branch become motionless although we
can observe you no longerno you will continue the same unconscious
of the pleasure or the regret you occasion and insensible of any
change in those who walk under your shadebut who will remain to
enjoy you
